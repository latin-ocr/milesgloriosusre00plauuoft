NOTES. 145

68. rogare = milites conscribere, “to enlist recruits’'; the
full phrase is sacramento militem rogare. R, for once stooping
to explanation, gives this strange remark: ⁴⁴ uis rogare est
utendaspetfsff’ But the words could not bear that meaning3
and these words, rightly interpreted, show that this verse should
stand here, not after 37, where R places it, following the mss.

71. praeolat mihi, “that Ι should scent beforehand what
you want,'' i. e. that I should know what you want before you
mention it, as a dog knows his master before he sees him.
Praeolat is iinpersonal. olere and its compounds are found in
Plautus to conform generally to the 2nd conjugation, but
sometimes (as here) to the 3rd. So we have exsadz‘ri, 314, as if
the verb were of the 4th conjugation3 parire for pare‘re Vidul.
Fr. 213 moriri and aggrediri often; cupz'ret Lucr. i. 713 and
ffcgzrz' in Publ. Syr. 815.

72. tempus ut eamus, “time to go'': cp. 1101.

74. latrones, (1) “mercenaries'’ ; quz'conductimz'lz'tabantFes-
tus3 (2) robbers; (3) latrones and latrunculi also mean
“draughtsmen.” Latrocz'narz' = (Ι) to r0b; (2) to serve as a
mercenary. Latrocz‘m'um = (1) mercenary service3 (2) a game
of draughts; (3) robbery; (4) a band of robbers.

ibus, archaic for eis, on the analogy of quibus, except that
ibus has the penult. long. So bibus = his Cur. iv. 2. 20. For
construction see on 140.

75. Seleucus. No special Seleucus is referred to ; the name
is used just as aliquem ad regem in Trin. iii. 2. 96.

78. age eamus: cp. age . . . abite 928; so caue for cauete
Men. v. 7. 53 and caue dz‘rumpatz's Poen. prol. 117.

ACT ΙΙ.

This speech of Palaestrio is really a prologue. In only one
other os the extant plays of Plautus is the prologue deferred
until the audience is made acquainted with the leading charac-
ten'stics of one or more of the chief dramatis personae. In the
Cistellaria it is only after Silem'um and Gymnasium have, in an
opening scene of much power, disclosed their different charae-
ters, and the Lena, in a second scene, has related the story of
Silenium that the prologue proper is spoken by the goddess
