xxx INTRODUOTION.

for the last twelve plays of Plautus; only the first
eight plays were known in the beginning of the 15th
century3 the last twelve had disappeared. D closely

agrees with C, so that it seems probable that they
come from a common archetype.

(4). A, the codex Ambrosianus, now in the Ambro-
sian Library at Milan. It was discovered by A. Mai
in the Ambrosian Library. It is probably of the
5th century; but in the 8th century it was washed
and scraped to receive a copy of the Book of Kings.
Thus the original writing was greatly obliterated,
but much of it has been deciphered by the successive
labours of Mai himself, Schwarzmann, Ritschl, Gep-
pert‚ and Studemund‚

BCD, which are sometimes called the Vatican,
Palaffine, or Roman⁹⁵ codices, Ι have for brevity in my
notes designated by M (as the first letter of manu-
script). M signifies BCD together, and Ι use it as a
singular—‘⁶ M has,'' &o When I speak of the mss
singly Ι call thern, as usual, B, C, D. Ι give the
reading of A wherever it is recorded: A (R) = A as
read by Ritschl ; A (Gepp.) = A as read by Geppert;
A (Stud.) =A as read by Studemund. In addition to
the above, Ritschl sometimes gives the readings ofG
and H (Roman codices) and E (bought by Ritschl in
Etruria). These, as being admittedly ofaltogether in-
ferior value, I never include in my apparatus criticus.
But R gives throughout a full collation of two other
authorities, which I occasionally quote, but do not
give throughout ; they are :—

(5). F, the codex Lipsiensis, a ms of the 15th cen·
tury, in the possession of the senate of the Univer-
sity of Leipsic. This is hardly deserving of the
name of a ms; it ought rather to be called a state

θ’ Β and D are now in Rome ; C was restored to Heidelberg
in the beginning of the present century.
