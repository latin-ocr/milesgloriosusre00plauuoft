N OTES. 169

words have the same number of letters,’' making littem‘s an
abl. of attendant circumstances, as ΒΧ does. According to
my view, litteris is the Ablativus mensurae, as it is called
by Draeger (Historische Syntax, ii. p. 562); it is the same abl.
as we have in multis partibus maior Cic. N. D. ii. 36). For the
phrase, cp. meis orationibus omnibus litteris, “ in my speeches,
every letter of them,’' Cic. Att. i. 14. 3.

322. quid. iam. ΒΧ is disposed, here and in other places, to
take quid as the abl. with the old ablatival d‚· so that quid
would = quidum, “how do you mean, how do you make that

out?” So in 277, 469, 472, 818, 834, 1203.

324. quid domi, “What do you mean by at home? '’ asin
31 .

325. luto: see on 90.

326. capiti tuo, a common periphrasis for tibi: cp. capitulo
584. Another common periphrasis is aetati tuae = tibi: cp.
uetustate uino edentulo aetatem z'rrzges, “moisten your clay
with wine mellowed by age (toothless from old age),’' Poen.

iii. 3. 87.

327. alia: sc. oratione, “change for another‚'’ not the adverb
alia, though it occurs in Rud. prol. 10.

329. nihil est qua = nulla uia est qua, on the analogy os
nihil est cur = nulla causa est cur.

330. quin, “ why there she is,” in denial of the last words of
Sc. In Cas. ιιι. 4, we find quin repeated a great many times,
until Alc. says numquam tibi lzodz'e quin erit plusquam mihi,
⁴⁴ 1 promise you you won’t have a why more than 1.”

331. mihi: see on 236.

332. quin sit, sor quin credam eam esse: cp. 188.

333. subrepsit: see on 316.

334. meus illic homost, “ I have him on the hip” (he is in
my power) ; so meus hic est, hamum uorat Cur. iii. 61 : in 615
meus homo has a quite different sense = “ a man after my own
heart.’' So noster esto is often a phrase of high commendation =
“commend me to you’¹; but noster est (350) = “belongs to

our household, is one of us.'’
