NOTES. 159

tincture of learning‚’' and imbuere always refers to the informal
teaching of nature as contrasted with the formal teaching os
art. So also informata = “in outline, in its first rude shape ”x
cp. sor the form indzffiiscor, indugredi, iuduperator.

barbaro = Romano. Plautus uses barbarus in the meaning
it would have in the mouth of his Greek originals‚ i. e. “not
Greek-speaking ”2 cp. Maccius uortz't barbare As. 11 ; barba—
rica lege Capt. iii. 1. 32 ; barbaricae urbes iv. 2. 1043 so in Bar-
baria = z'n Italia Poen. iii. 2. 21, where a curious custom is
alluded to, namely, that lupines passed sor gold on the stage:
“it is gold‚” says CoHybiscus, “stage g01d3 the sort of gold
on which Italian beeves grow sat when it is soaked in water,-
but for the present it must enact the part of a Philip.” Cic.
Orat. 160 has barbaris casibus. Plautus uses barbarus in a
distinctly depreciatory sense = rudis, indoctus in Bacch. i. 2.
133 and yet, in the next verse but one, he uses it as a synonym
sor Romano.

²13· bini custodes, i. e. the chains on his hands and feet.

totis = omnibus.

214. adstitit: last syllable long, as often in Plautus. For
the Plautine use of this word, see on 204.

euscheme. These adjectives corne from Greek (εὐσχήμως,
δουλικῶς &c.), but are inflected as if they were Latin adverbs:
cp. compsz'ssume = κομψότατα 941 ; basilice = βασιλικῶς Poen. iii.
1. 74 ; ineuscheme (according to mss) Trin. iii. 1. 24 ε other in-
stances of Greek words with Latin inflections are—musice, more,
prothyme‚ graphice, pancratice, athletice, pugilice ; and the sub-
stantives, prothymz'as Stich. ii. 2. 11; eccheumatis Poen. iii. 3.
88 ; and morium 883, below.

haste: cp. bibe si bibis Stich. v. 4. 51 ; sacsisacis Most. i. 47. 1;
quin datis si quid datis, Cas. iv. 1. 7.

216. uarius uirgis: cp. cras Phoenicium phoenicio corio
inuises pergulam Pseud. i. 2. 97.

217. tibi ego dico, the usual form for bespeaking attention,
like our ‘⁴ Ι say.’' Cic. uses narro tibi in the same wav.
