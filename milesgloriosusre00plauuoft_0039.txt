which is Ephesus throughout. The stage shows the
houses of the Miles and of Periplecomenus.*
Sceledrus, a slave of the stsiles, especially charged
with the safe keeping of Philocomasium, while walk—
ing on the roof, which in ancient houses seems to
have been a favourite lounge for idle servants, wit—
nesses through the impluvium one of the interviews
between Pleusicles and Philocomasium. This is a
serious mishap‚ and Palaestrio addresses himself
to the task of obviating evil results therefrom.
If Sceledrus should tell the ffilz'les what he has seen
they are undone. There is no resource but to per-
suade him out of beliefin the evidence ofhis senses.
Accordingly Palaestrio persuades his fellow-slave‚
Sceledrus, that Glycera, a twin-sister of Philocoma—
sium, as like her as is one drop of milk to another,
has come to Ephesus, and is living with her lover at
the house of Periplecomenus. Philocomasium pre-
tends to be Glycera. It is managed that she shall be
seen by Sceledrus sacrificing to Diana of the Ephe-
sians, in gratitude for her preservation from the
dangers of the deep, and her safe arrival in Ephesus.
Sceledrus is fully persuaded that he was mistaken in
supposing that he had seen Philocomasium in the
house of Periplecomenus, and is much alarmed
about the punishment which may be inflicted on him
at the instance of Philocomasium for his mistake.
Here ends Act ΙΙ, which is virtually the first Act
of the play; for Act Ι consists of only one scene, in

which the stupidity and vanity of the Miles are dis·
played in a very well-written dialogue with a para-
site, Artotrogus, who does not afterwards appear.
With Act III the play takes a wholly new departure.

¹* According to Dziazko there wrm, in some acting editions at
least, a third house on the stage, belonging to Acroteleutium.
