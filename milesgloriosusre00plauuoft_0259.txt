Ν OTES. 163

(Aul. iii. 6. 17, Cur. iv. 4. 31). “A couple of days ’' is duos
aliquos dies ; “ some three weeks‚” uzgz'ntz' aliquos dies.
Where we should say “ only a week or so '’ the Latin has unos
sex dies (see Trin. i. 2. 1293 Cist. ii. 1. 22) ; and when we should
say “ about a fortnight‚” Latin has quindecim dies (Trin. ii.
4. 1) ; so in Fr. quinzejours.

252. operae non. est : see 318, “ she is not at leisure for it,”
literally, “it is not a thing (a case) of work‚'' = “it is not a
thing about which she feels bound to trouble herself.” Operae
is the genetivus generis. This phrase is quite different from
operae (pretium) est. The phrase opera mihi est is also found
as the opposite of opera non est here, and means, “I have
leisure '' (i. e. the matter is a work to me, a thing which claims
my attention) : cp. sioperast auribus Mero. prol. 145 dicam si
uideam tibi esse operam aut otium, where operam comes to
mean very much the same as otium : cp. operae mz' ubz' erit ad
te uenero Truc. iv. 4. 30. slightly different is propter quam
operast mz'lzz', “ sor whom Ι am exerting myself‚'' 1086.

non potest,'“it is impossible‚'' impersonal, as often in
Plautus. We have also non potis est in same sense. So non
potest quin, 603, 693.

253. prima uia, “ at the first go off '’ ; literally “ at the be-
ginning of the whole business ” : cp. a meo primo nomine
Trin. iv. 2. 35, and prima uespera, prima fabula‚· so primum
dzjgitum, “ finger-tip '' Cat. ii. 3 (cp. dzgrz'tulis primoribus Bacch.
iv. 4. 24); prima lingua, “ tip of tongue” Plin. H. N. xi. 172.

255. istist = istic est as illi = illic.

256. dice, monstra, praecipe. The words occur again
together, Capt. ii. 2. 109.

258. docte perdoctam : cp. parce parcus, inpudenter inpu-

ιέζις, ‘misere miser, scite scitus, fidele fidelis. For dabo, see on
g. 1. 1 1.

259. numquid aliud, elliptical‚ see 575 ; 5ο, also, numquid
me aliud Ter. Eun. ii. 3. 72 ; the most usual form of the phrase
is numquid uis ‚· this was a polite form of Ieave-taking. Dona-
tus on Ter. Eun. ii. 3. 49 sayS‚ abituri ne id dure facerent
numquid uis dicebant z‘z's quibuscum constitissent. The phrase
quid nunc uis· on the contrary was distinctly rude, as we may
gather from Amph. iv. 2. 5, Quid nunc uis? to which the
reply is, sceleste, at etiam quid uelim id tu me rogas.
