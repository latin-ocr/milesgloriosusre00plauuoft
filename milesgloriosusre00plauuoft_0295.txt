and by the alliteration in which tlze scene abounds, and quite
justified by the license of comic usage. Here I believe
that qui farcit means the sansage-maker, ἀλλαντοπώλης, “he
who makes chopped meat into sausages‚” “ the dealer in
moretum, alliatum,” which was the staple food of the Roman
middle classes. But quisarcz't may also mean “ the dealer in
fat poultry‚” as in gallinas et anseres sic farcito Cato R. R.

cook’' ε cp. non ego item cenam condio ut aliz· coci Pseud. iii. 2.

is not only against the mss, and itself objectionable as a phrase,
but is also out of keeping with the rest of the passage, in which

the wife is made always to ask sor money to make presents, or

was a festival in honour of Minerva, held from 19th to 23rd of
March (5th day after the Ides, whence the name). The Quin.
minusculae were held on the Ides of June, and lasted for three
days, but were called by the same name as the greater, quod
tibicines tum feriati negantur per urbem et conueniunt ad

aedem Illineruae.

693. flagitiumst. These words are supposed to mean “it
is a shame is nothing is sent to her: how cross she looks.”
This, it will be allowed, does not give a very apt sense, even
granting that these words can have this meaning. But quae,
not quo, is the reading of all the mss worthy os the name. See
critical note, where I have defended quae supercilio spicit, and
suggested as an alternative a conjectural emendation of the pas-

sage.
