NOTES. 197

For si sit possum cp. nec Salus nobis saluti iam esse si cupiat
potest Most. ii. Ι. 4.

765. praeuerti in Pl. is followed by accus. of pronouns; dat.
of substantives. In Cist. v. 8 we have praeuorti hoc certumst
rebus aliis omnibus.

igitur refers to otium si sit, “ then, as we have not 1eisure.”

766. hoc = huc, acc. to ΒΧ, and undoubtedly hoc often = huc
in Pl. ; but it is possible that here the phrase animum adzcortere
is treated as one word, and governs hoc in the accus, so we
have ubi quadruplator quempiam iniexit manum Pers. i. 2. 18.
This constr. is common in Gk.

768. admutiletur: see 588. Vsque is found withprobe in
Capt. ii. 2. 13, usque admutilabit probe ; more fully in usque
admutilauistz' ad cutem Pers. v. 2. 53 ; as here in attonsae qui-
dem ambae usque sunt Bacch. v. 2. 7.

772. igitur, “ then.’'

774. institi, perf. of insistere .· for accus. cp. 793, 929.

epithet magnus.

778. ultro, “ unasked.’'

779. edepol qui: see on 604. De isto = de ista re: cp. de
istoc quietus esto Cur. iv. 2. 6. Nunc, the conjecture of Acida-
lius, has been accepted for non by all subsequent commentators
down to the present day. WVrongly‚ as I think. Non is the
reading of all the mss, including even F and Z. It has been
hastily assumed that non is an obvious slip‚ because at first
sight it seems inconsistent with the required sense. Yet a care-
ful consideration will show that it is nunc which is incon-
sistent with the whole tone of the play, while non is a thoroughly
Plautine touch, and gives a sentiment entirely suited to the
character of the speaker. Palaestrio says that the Miles boasts
“that all the women in Ephesus uninvited run after him.’'
Now if we read nunc, Periplecomenus replies, “Aye, saith
there's many a man in Ephesus would fain thou wert now
lying,'’ and thus he pays a tribute to the attractions of the
Miles, and represents him as really a lady-killer and successful
rival of husbands. Yet the Miles is throughout depicted as a
