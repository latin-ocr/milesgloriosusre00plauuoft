BASE COMPARISONS.
(HENRY 1v.‚ PT. 1., Aer 11„ SCENE 4.)

FALSTAFF—PRINCE—POINS.

Fal. But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
knaves in Kendal-green came at my back and let drive at me;
for it was so dark, Hal, that thou eouldst not see thy hand.

Prince. These lies are like their father that begets them;
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay—brained
{giggil—thou knotty-pated sool, thou obscene, greasy tallow

Flllss What, art thou mad ? art thou mad ? is not the truth the
trut .

Prz'nce. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal-
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand?
corne, tell us your reason z what sayest thou to this ?

Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.

Fal. What! upon compulsion? ’Zounds, an I were at the
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on
compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! if reasons
were as plentiful as blackberries, Ι would give no man a reason
upon compulsion—I.

Prince. I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
ἓῗκέἓζὲἐὴίε bed-presser, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill

Fal. ’SbloocL you starveling‚ you elf-skin‚ you dried neat's
tongue, you stock-fish! O sor breath to utter what is like thee!
you sheath‚ you bow-case, you vile standing-tuck—

Prince. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
when thou hast tired thyself in base coinparisons, hear me
speak but this.

Poins. M ark, Jack.
SHAKSPEARE.
