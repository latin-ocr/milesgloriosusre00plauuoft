pzs scelera Pseud. iii. 2. 28. On the other hand, we find the ge-
netive usually in this phrase ; indeed, one passage in which this
phrase is followed by a gen. is almost decisive against the
theory that scelerum is an adj. ε scelerum caput Ι ut tute's item
omnis censes esse periuri eaput Rud. iv. 4. 55. If scelerum

gere an adj.‚ it might be compared with uerbereum caput
ers. 11. 2. 2.

496. auscultem ‘cibi : see on 482. It seems strange to us that
a slave should address one in the position of Periplecomenus as
uz'cz'ne. There was no respectful form of address to superiors in
Rome; even kings and queens, as Amphitruo and Alcumena,
are addressed by their slaves as Amphitruo and Alcumena, and

this, too, though the master and mistress held over the slave the
power of life and death.

497. expurigare = expurgare; so z'umg‘are, with its com·
pounds, for iurgare, purigare for purgare: these are formed on
the analogy of nauzgrare, rengare διο.

501. licetne, “may I (speak)'': cp. pater licetne pauca
ggcgtggsser. Andr. v. 3. 22; in 521 the ellipse is of dicere .· see

l502. uirgarum, rods (generally of elm) used for chastisnig
s aves.

mihi supplicium . . . de te datur = mihi datur ius sup-
plici de te sumendi: cp. As. ii. 4. 73—76.

505. condignam te: see 285, homo sectatu's m'lzz'lz' nequam

bestiam. This word is always used by Pl. in a depreciatory
sense.

507. amplexam, passive: see on 172.

511. supplicium stimuleum, “The knout.” Punishment
was inflicted on slaves with—(1) uirgae, or rods chiefly of elm;
(2) leather thongs, scutica, lora ; (3) with the flagrum (flagel-
lum), awhip‚ with lashes knotted and perhaps wired. This last
is osten spoken osas stimuli, and may be rendered the “ knout.’'
For the form stimuleum, cp. hospitio pugneo Amph. i. 1. 140:
tibi messis z'n ore fiet mergis pugneis Rud. iii. 4. 58.

512. dedecoris pleniorem, i. e. 1 shall cover him with in·
famy by taking an action sor damages against him.

514. ita sum &c. ‘⁴ Ι am reduced to such a strait, that Iam
