158 MILES GLORIOS VS.

Ennius has egregie cordatus homo catus Aelz'u’ Sextus ‚⁸ Ennius
was said to have tria corda because he understood three lan·
gunges, Latin, Greek, and Oscan.

204. auortit: cp.1074; = auortz'tse, as Verg. Aen. i. 104,
prora auertzt; and auertens ib. 401. So uortat in the common
phrase quae res bene uortat. ΒΧ takes auortz't as the perfect of
the deponent auortz',· but it is much better to regard it as used
intransitively sor auortz't se, especially as the present is used
throughout, except in concrepuzsst which stands alone as indicat-
ing a inomentary act. For adstzz'z' 1s always used as a present in
Plautus. It is the perfect of adsisto, and means ‘⁶ Ι stand,
ἕστηκα) ’A good instance is Men v. 2. 112, iam adstzffltz 111 cur-
mm, iam lora teneo.- see also below, 1254. Adsti'tz never
means “I st00d” in Plautus, though it does in Ter. Ph. 867,
placide z're perrexz, accessz, adltz'lz. With auertit = auortz't se,
cp. lenzunt 583; resoluas (sc. te) Amph. ii. 2. 73· , znsz'nuat
⁴ (sc. se) Cist. 1. 1. 93; rugat (sc se) Cas. ii. 3. 32.

205. seruit3 feruere is always 3rd conjugation in Plautus:
cp. sor the sense, quem . ..faciam feruentem flagris Amph. iv.
2. 10.

208. eccere, “there n0w”; originally ecce rem, the m
droppled as in postmodo, propemodo. Postmodum is found in
Pseu . 1. 342.

209. incoctum . . . coctum: see 193.

212. os columnatum. The attitude of Palaestrio, who
supports his head on his hand and arm, as ison a column, re-
minds Plautus of his brother-poet Naevius, imprisoned for his
lampoons on the aristocracy. The imprisonment of Naevius is
placed about 210—207 B. c · 50 that we have the date of the
Miles very nearly, if we supposed it to have been produced
dum-ng the imprisonment: in any case it must have been aster
the imprisonment began3 but the reference put into the mouth
of Periplecomenus may, ofcourse, be to abygone event. A pos-
terior limit has been sought 111 the allusion m verse 1016 to the
Bacchae, whose exposure b{too} place about 186 B. C. But there
is no reason why such an allusion as thatin verse 1016 should not
be made after the criminal practices of the Bacchae had been
made the subject os prosecution, as well as before.

indaudiui. Indaudz‘uz‘ means “to overhear by chance, to
