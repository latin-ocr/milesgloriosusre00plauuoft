NOTES. 201

826. qui, “How came it that he went asleep? With hjs
eyes.'’ The same joke recurs in Merc. i. 2. 72.

830. notuit = uetuit. So uocare is the archaic form of uacare.
Hence the play on the word uocent in Cas. iii. 1. 13 2—-

St. Fac habeatnt linguam tuae aedes. Al. Quid ita? St. Quom ueniam
uocen .

831. heminas. The hssmina = half a sextarius.
832. in prandium, “ for his luncheon.’'

834. quia enim: see 1001. “Why! because.” Enz'm is
corroborative, not fflative : see on 1289.

835. gutturem: see on 18.

842. Lureio. So Fl. spells the name of this slave. He holds
that such characters should always have a Greek name; but a
stronger reason for giving up the ordinary reading, Lucrio, is that
that word would of course come from lucrum, which has the z'c'
naturally short. Now, Plautine prosody does not permit the
leng thening of a naturally short vowel by a succeeding mute and
liquid. Lumo dz'scruciabere can hardly be admittedt> either, for
a dactyl' m this part of the senarius is avoided by Pl. Yet Lucrio
would give an excellent sense to an otherwise somewhat point-
less verse, “in spite of your auspz'cz'ous name, you will come to
the rack.’ ’' PL, moreover, is fond of playin⁵g on names. We
have in the Bacchides a play on Λυδός and ludus ,· in the Persa
on Σατυρίων and satur; in the Pseudulus on Σιμίας and simia.

844. itan uero, “ Oh, yes 1⁹⁹ ironical.

deliees, “ blab'' = delz'ques = claerfy = explain.

845. sagina . . . cellaria, “my storeroom·cramming.’'
846. promptet = promat.

850. hoe: lzac de causa, and zllz z'llic,· “that was the reason
why the wine· -jars so often stood on their heads there” (i. e.
were turned upside down, to empty them of their contents).
See on 2973 so zstoc in next v=erse ista de causa

851. cassabant == quassabant: cp. delices = delz'ques; ‘⁵ that
was not the reason why the jars were so unsteady.” But Prof.
Nettleship thinks it is freq. of cado. Paul. Fest. has, p. 48,
cassabundus frequenter cadens: see also Varr. L. L. 7, 53.
