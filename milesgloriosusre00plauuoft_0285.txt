NOTES. 185

Pz'pulo improbo, the conjecture of R, is not justified by the inter-
view between Sc. and Phil. above, nor by the habitual usage of
the word pz'pmo ‚· rnoreover, A is against it. See crit. note.

585 must be corrupt, as Ribbeck pointed out, for it distinctly
contradicts 582, 586, 593.

587. occisam . . . suem. A reference to the crit. note
will show how various have been the attempts of successive edd.
to impart sense to this passage. Lorenz was the first to perceive
that a verse must have dropped out. But even though we pos-
tulate a lacuna here, supplying the sentiment which ΒΧ and
Lor. supply, no satisfactory sense emerges. For let us suppose
the lost verse to have contained words answering in sense to
‘⁶ than this fool Sceledrus''; then the sense of the whole passage
would be :—-“ I am quite sure that a slaughtered sow has often
more' sense than this blockhead, who is choused into not seeing
what he saw.'' But—(1) occisa sus is not among the many types
os stupidity in PL, and is not at all likely to be so used; and
(2) what is to be done with saepe? If it be taken into account,
we should rather expect sapz'sse than sapere. Can there be in
the passage any allusion to the custom referred to in Men. ii. 2.
16, and testified to by Varro (R. R. iv. 16), of offering pigs to
obtain the restoration of a sound mind? The passage (with a
slight modification of 587) would then have run somewhat
thus :-

Sat edepol certo scio
Orissa saepe sapere plus multo sue
Insanos ; sed illsne opus haras! plena Suom

Qui adeo admutilatur ne id quod uidit uiderit?

⁴⁸ I know that madmen osten become much more sensible
through the slaughter of a sow, but would not thz'sfellow require
a whole stye to be sacrzficedfor him, since he is cajoled into not
having seen what he actually lias seen ?'’ Ι need not add that
the italicised words are merely intended to represent the sort of
sentiment that might have been conveyed by the lost verse. Of
as course illine = nonne z'llz‘,· as Pl. does not use nonne.

588. admutilatur, lit. “to shave close'': cp. me usque ad-
mutz'lasti ad cutem Pers. v. 2. 53. Similar metaphors are
common in Pl. ε as senex est in tonstrina Capt. ii. 2. 163 deton-
debo auro Bacch. ii. 3. 7 ; and attondit in same play.

592. senatum, ‘⁶ consultation'': cp. quid tu te solusesenatu
seuocas Aul. iii. 6. 13 ; iam senatum conuocabo in corde consilia-
rium Epid. i. 2. 56.
