“inasmuch as (especially as) her sister has arrived‚’' διε. This
usage is ascribed to sicut only in one other passage in Latin
literature, Epid. ii. 2. 87, for Pers. i. 3. 57 is a highly doubtful
passage. Langen (Beitriige, p. 249) rightly denies the possibi-
lity of this usage of sicut, and adduces passages in which sicut
is used to introduce an explanation or illustration of what goes
before : see above on v. 518, where he would render sicut . . .
nescio ‘² 1 mean, I do not know.'' Epid. ii. 2. 87 easily falls in
with his theory, nunc occasiost faciundi priusquam in urbem
aduenerit, Ι sz'cut cras hic aderit; hodie haud uenerit, “beforehc
comes to the city, I mean before to-morrow‚'’ “morgen πᾶνπ-
lz'clz wird er hier sein.'’ Here the sentence is elliptical. Pal.
would naturally have said, “ Tell her to go where she pleases—
Ι mean, tell her to go with her sister and mother, who are wait-
ing for her.” What he does say is, “ tell her to go where she
pleases '’ (and an opportunity offers itself), “ Ι mean (for
instance) her mother and sister are here,'’ &c. The sen-
tence is better explained by supposing sicut to rest on some
such ellipse as 1 have postulated‚ than to ascribe to sicut
a most unnatural and quite unexampled signification. Langen
supplies a slightly different ellipse, “Ich gebe dir diesen
Rath, die Mutter und Schwester sind namlich da, um sie
zu holen.'' We might reproduce the idiom by a French
phrase, “Tell her to go where she pleases3 ὰ propos her
mother and sister are here, and want to take her,”

977. occasionem . . . ut t cp. spes ut Bacch. iii. 1. 3 ; causa
est ut Capt. ii. 2. 7. Extrudam is the conjecture of Lambinus
for excludam of the mss, which perhaps it is wrong to reject3
extrudam has been (perhaps hastily) accepted on the Lambinian
canon “ extruditur qui intus est, excluditur qui uolt quidem
introire sed prohibetur introitu.'’ Yet from one point of view,
extrudere ‘⁶ to put out '’ is hardly so suitable here as excludere,
“to put out and keep out’'; and indeed excludam might be
defended by the use of prohibebo in an analogous passage in
Ter. Phorm. 42 5, aut quidem cum uxore hac ipsum prohibebo
domo.

979. per gratiam, “ amicably‚” so in 1125, 1200.
983. mutet fidem, “break faith‚⁷’ as in Phorm. 512.

984. Vah . . . amet, “Tut! you're joking3 why you are
the apple of her eye.'’ For quae amet, see on 62. For oculos,
cp. 1330, and oculissumum Cur. i. Ι. 16 (= carissumum, cp.
