Auxilium. So that the prologue is in effect divided between the
Lena and Auxilium. Euripides, in the Iphigenia z'n Aulis, has
taken a somewhat similar course. The whole speech of Palaestrio
seems to be made up ofthree parts—(1)79- 87‚whichwas probably
part of a post· -Plautine prologue prefixed to the play, and not
spoken by Palaestrio; (2) 88- 94, a part of another rival pro
logue used by anoth er company of actors; (3) 95- 155, the
remains of the yoriginal Plautine speech of Palaestrio.

80. benignitas. cp. date benigne operam mz'lzz' As. prol. 14.
The post-Plautine imitator probably copied Men. prol. 16, where
benignitas is used in its Plautine sense (though the prologue is
not Plautine), not in the sense of “ kindness'' required here;
bem'gm'tas in Plautus means “generosity‚ openhandedness'';
and malzgnz'tas, “stinginess, niggardliness’'; benzgne in As.
quoted above = “ kindly '’; but the prologue of the Asinaria is
not by Plautus.

81. exsurgat foras. For this pregnant use of exsurgo, cp.
ἵὲοὲῖιιίῳιῐαφέὅεχςιινὲαίιζς Bacch. iv. 4. 1065 surgedum huc

82. sedeat. It is certain that in the time of Plautus there
was no sitting accommodatiori in the Roman theatres; yet we
find even in undoubtedly Plautine passages (e. g. Aul. iv. 9. ὁ)
references to a sitting public. We must therefore suppose that
the spectators either brought with them stools and- chairs, or
seated themselves on the ground. Val. Maximus says distinctly
(ii. 4. 2), that in the censorship of Messalla and Cassius (599),
when it was proposed to erect a stone theatre, the proposal was
rejected on the motion of Scipio Nasica: atque etiam Scto
cautum est ne quis in urbe propiusue passus mille subsellza
posuisse sedensue ludos spectare uellet, ut scilicet remissioni
animorum standi uirilitas propria Romanae gentis iuncta
esset. The Theatrum Pompei, the first stone theatre, was built
just a hundred years after this Sctum.

83. qua eausa; cuius causa wonld be plainer, but the

εονηῙοεᾱιέ 1s itself the causa why the spectators took their seats
m t ie t eatre.

84. comoediai. We find this form very often in Plautus,
both in nouns, adjectives, and prononns, especially' m proper
names of Greel< origin, such as Charmzdaz': this form is also
used by Ennius, Lucretius, Cicero in his poems, and Vergil3
but not by Terence m any dertain passage.
