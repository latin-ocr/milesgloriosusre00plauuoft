Sosia z‘ntust Amph. ii. 2. 218. So one often hears in English
the mixed expression, “ do you think will it rain ?'' Becker
and others would resort to conjecture, so as to make the lan-
guage of Pl. conform to the rules of later Lat.; but Bx and
Ussing rightly refuse to bring the colloquialism ofevery-day dia-
logue under the rules of formal composition.

520. ad me, “to my house '²1 see on 151. Cic. in his Let-
ters uses ad me to indicate particularly his house in Rome, as
distinguished from his country seats.

521. licetne: see on 501: quin = “nay more'' (not only
will I permit it, but Ι enjoin it on you) ε ei = z', imper. of e0.

523. curriculo, lit. “ with running” (as in unum curriculum
face Trin. iv. 4, 11); generally, as here, it means “quickly,”
and is used not only with currere, but with uenire, ire (and its
compounds), sequi, molare, adferre, and even with fui in
Stich. ii. 2. 13.

ita negotiumst‚ “that's what you've got to do.’' In 816
msz' negotiumst = “ unless you have something (else) to do.'’

52 5. rusum, archaic sor rursum,· so for prorsus, prosus and
prosum.

526. infuseauerit: se. mulier .· “make a mull of it”; in·
fuscare is to spoil wine by too copious infusion of water, as we
see from Cist. i. 1. 20; so if our phrase, to make a mull of
a thing, refers to mulled wine, it is a fairly adequate rendering
of infuscare.

527. The sense of the lacuna is thus supplied by R:—

Si hic non uidebit mulierem lusce in aedibus
Omnis erit res palam. Sed aperitur foris.

530. utpote quae non &c., “ For a woman who is not the
same,'’ “ considering that she is not one and the same.⁷’
Exactly the same use is found in Rud. ii. 5. 5, satis nequam
sum utpote qui hodie amare inceperim, “sor one who began
(considering I began) to intrigue to-day.'' The only other place
where the phrase occurs is a very suspicions passage, Bacch. iii.
4. 13, amo hercle opino utpote quod pro certo sciam, where if we
ate to ascribe the same meaning to the phrase as it bears here
and in the Rudens we must render “I am in love, I think
(which 1 am justified in saying), as 1 am sure of it‚”
