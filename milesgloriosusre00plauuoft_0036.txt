blessedness of celibacy, the affectations of society,
and the shallowness of its refinement. In fact, as
O. Ribbeck observes, the whole second act is, in the
subsequent progress of the piece‚ virtually ignored.
Even the injunctions, 805 ff„ never come to any-
thing. And it is not till verse 1175 that the in-
structions are given to Palaestrio on which he really
acts, in carrying out his part in the overreaching
of the Miles. These and other inconsistencies are
too great to be ascribed to that greedy careless-
ness which was noticed by Horace;'³¹'· and they
have led Dziazko to the conclusion that the play is
the result of elaborate contaminatio: perhaps, how-

ever, they may be best explained by the theory ofthe
’ existence of a second actinge(ht10n—a theory which
certainly falls 1n with the character of the prologue—
speech already referred to, and seems in itself a far
from improbable hypothesis.

Yet, in spite of these defects, the play is excellent
reading, and we must remember that such blemishes
in artistic execution would be hardly noticeable
in a piece which must have far more resembled
an opera bouffe than a modern comedy. The plays of
Plautus were⁴ acted without any division into acts
and scenes,† or any pause, except when the plot
requ1red that an actor should leave the stage at the
end of one scene and appear again at the beginning
of the next. In these cases a tibicen entertained the
spectators while the stage was empty. This is ex-
pressly referred to in the pseudulus at the end of the
first Act, and no doubt under these circumstances the
tibicen was always resorted to: but except in such
cases there was no pause in the acting. Another
