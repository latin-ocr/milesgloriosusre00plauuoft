reading of the Ambrosian palimpsest may be, we
are loth to rebel against the authority of a codex
which has thrown such a flood of light on the text

who was really a stout young slave masquerading as
a girl, “put down her foot like an elephant.’' It
will be interesting to observe when this new example
of the old Latin word for an elephant will get into
the Lexicons. They have not yet noticed attexta in
the De Rep. of Cicero. The value of the testimony
of A is, however, seriously impaired by the discre-
pancies between the reports of the different critics
who have examined it and recorded its readings.
For instance, in this passage, Mil. Glor. 684, Stude-
mund has elicited a very different reading from A—
