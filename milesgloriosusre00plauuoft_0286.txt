186 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

595. de . . . fuat, “lest they cast lots in my absence”; an
allusion to the sortitio prouinciarum in the Roman senate. At
the conference there would be assigned to each one his or her
part in carrying out the overreaching of the Miles, as the
provinces were allotted to the different magistrates.

ACT IIL—SCENE Ι.

598. concilium, for concilio, by attraction to the case of the
relative; see on 140.

599. nequis. Ne is a negative particle found in nemo, ne
utiquam, rze umquam, nullus, noenum = ne unum.- cp. the
archaic use of nec in nec recte dicere, “ to abuse ”3 nec ullum =
nullum Trin. ii. 2. 5 ; nec utrum :neutrum Lucr. v. 839. Nec
survives in negotium, neglegentia, necopznus, and in old Law
phrases, as res nec mancipi, furtum nec manufestum. Spolia
capiat = surripere in 600. Military metaphors are abundant
here (see 597, 011); so above, 210 ff. See metaplzor in Index.

602. inconsultumst‚ “our deep-laid plans are no better

{hahz'nalzszretions ’¹ (to use two phrases employed correlatively
y arn et .

604. qui: see 779. Pl. and Ter. often attach qui as a corro-
borative to particles of asseveration: cp. horum tz‘bz'z'stz'c nihil
eueniet quippe qui Ι ubi quid subripias m'lzz'l est Aul. ii. 5. 22 ;
quippe qui Ι magnanon id saepe remedium aegrz'tudz‘numst
Ter. Heaut. 538; quippe qui nemo aduenit Bacch. iii. Ι. 2; so
also quippe ego quz‘Epid. iii. 2. 31 ; quippe qui Rud. ii. 3. 533
Truc. i. 1. 49. This asseverative particle in later Lat. is only
found in the compound atqui. In Pl. it is found not only with
quippe, but frequently with ut, pol, ecastor, edepol, hercle‚· in
many places it has been perversely expelled, but the usage
is now completely recognised by scholars. In the phrase at
pol qui it is not right to assume a tmesis of atqui, but to look
on quz' as the asseverative particle, as here. Qui is most fre-
quent with hercle, with which it is found in at least ten un-
doubted passages.

605. tuopte. The suffix -pte is found in Pl. with the cases
of the possessive pronouns in the singular, and once with the
personal pronoun mepte.
