INTR OD UCTION. xxiii

the matter was in his view. The key to the apparent
license of Plautine prosody is to be found in the in-
fluence ofaccent on early Roman poetry—an influence
which in the subsequent literature was completely
subordinated to the rigorous classification of every
syllable as long or short. The influence of the
accent on archaic prosody has been excellently ex-
plained and illustrated by Dr. Julius Brix in his
Introduction to the Trinummus. The following
views are mainly those of Dr. Brix‚ and do not claim
any originality except in the statement of the rules,
which I have endeavoured to make as general as
may be without being cumbrous. Two general rules
may be formulated as follows :—

(1). In words, or conzbz'nalz‘ons ofwords, forming in
ordinary prosody an iambus, if the accent (or ictus
metricus) be on the first syll., the long unaccented
syll. is shortened whether it be naturally long or long
by position, as no'uo liberto, pro'cvll recedas, po'l hic qm'-
dem, quo'd {niellexz} and this rule holds good even
though the long unaccented syll. be fused by elision
with another word, as 720²ch ornatu.

This rule illustrates the influence of the accent
forward on a succeeding syll. The second illustrates
the influence of the accent backward on a preceding
syll. It may be stated as follows :—

(2). In words orcombinatz'ons os words similarly form-
ing a bacchius (o — —), ifthe accent (or ictus metricus)
be on the third syll„ the second is shortened, whether
it be naturally long or long by position, as nou& quo'-
dam, ίαόἒνηάσιιίο, εεηέείιὶίί, β’νέηίίὶνίῖινη, per ἄηηόηαηῑ,
secl v‘a‘xo'rem ,· and this rule holds good also in cases of
elision, as scio dbsu'rde, ila ut dicz‘s.

It will be convenient here to refer to several ex-
emplifications of this rule in the Anapaestic passage,
