NOTES. 165

malam rem = malum 433. This conjecture of Bentley for
alienum is now actually found in A. This is the only place in
this play where Bentley has hit on a true reading, not arrived at
by others independently, whether before or after his time3 he
has made some 220 conjectures on the Miles. The words sibi
malam rem quaerere occur Cas. ii. 3. 48.

275. hic . . . hun03 so hanc . . . hac 1007.

277. uolup‚ an adverb, nearly always with est, like bene est,
aegre est ‚· but used twice with facere and once with uz'ctz'tare.
It cannot be spelt uolupe, as it sometimes stands at the end of a
verse: cp. facul for facile.

quid. iam : see 322.

279. maxumum in malum: see 531, 861; cruciatumque
further defines the malum “ punishment.'' We find maxumum
malum below, 547 ; Cas. iv. 4. 6 , Rud. iii. 4. 70.

insuliamus = z'nsz'lz'amus, “plunge into‚” an exaggerated
expression for incurramus .· cp. crucz'salus Bacch. ii. 3. 128.

282. aegas, one syllable, as sciat in As. iv. 1. 48. For tibi,
see on 23

283. faciam quin: see on 149, and Amph. i. 1. 242 there
quoted. This is a kind of confusion between non faczam qum
dicam and non potest qum scias: “I won t have you not to know
it.”

enim, emphatic = “surely, Ι tell you”; it osten stands first
in a sentence in Plautus. See on 1289.

286. te istuc aequomst. He was about to retort on Sc.
with “it is you the gods should eonfound,” but he changes his
mind, and says—-“ it is you that should go on with your story, as
you have begun it.” So in Capt. iv. 2. 88 Ergasilus is about to
retort the curse os Hegio, but checks himself and gives the sen-
tence another turn; so Epid. i. 1. 21 Di te perdant. T e uolo—
percontari: cp. also Pseud. i. 1. 35, at te di deaeque quantumst—
seruassint quidem.

287. forte fortuna. This is perhaps an example of the
usage cornmented on above, 258.

288. altero. This should properly mean one of two others
beside herself ; but it is used as here, Rud. prol. 74; Cist. iv.
