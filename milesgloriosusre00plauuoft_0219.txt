THE ARGUMENTS.

ΤΗΕ Arguments to the plays of Plautus are of two kinds—-
(1) the acrostichal argument, which is found before all the
extant plays except the Bacchides, the beginning of which
is lost. (2) A non-acrostichal argument, which was, no doubt,
originally prefixed to all the plays, but has perished except
in the smiles, Amphitruo, Aulularia, and Mercator. The
Ambrosian palimpsest preserves also such an argument to the
Pseudulus, and traces of one to the Persa. These last always
consist os fifteen senarii (except in the Amphitruo, in which
perhaps five verses are lost, as Ritschl thinks: nothing,
however, is wanting for the explanation of the play). It is
believed by R and others that they are the work of Sulpicius
Apollinaris of Carthage, the teacher of Gellius and Pertinax,
and the author of the Perz‘ochae prefixed to the plays of Terence
in twelve senarii, and the arguments, in six hexameters, prefixed
to the Books of the Aeneid. Whether the acrostichs are of
the same or a different period it is impossible to determine.
F. Ossan and others hold the acrostichs at least to be the work
of Aurelius Opilius, in the seventh century A. U. C.‚ about 100
years aster the death of Plautus. Gellius (iii. 3. Ι) mentions him
as author of indices to the Plautine plays, and probably such
was the nature of his Pinax, which contained an acrostich on
the name Opilius. Both classes of Argument (especially per-
haps the acrostichs) out-Plautus Plautus in their roughness os
diction and license of metre—a fact which perhaps should
lead us rather to assign their origin to the Antonine period,
when an imitator would be more likely than in the Sullan

{lpoch to get an exaggerated impression of the archaism of
au us.
