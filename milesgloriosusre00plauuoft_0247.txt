NOTES. 157

192. qui, sc. eum qui.

arguat: “let her in turn outface him who attacks her.'’
The verb arguo usually means to “ accuse, conviet‚'' Amph. iii.
2. 2, 4; participle argutus and adjective argutus (“ shrewd ’')
are played upon in Ecquid argutust? Malorum facinorum
saepissume, Pseud. i. 56, which one might render, “A tried
fellow? Aye, often for his life.'' Argutus generally means
“gub” in Plautus: see Truc. ii. 6. 12, 13, 14.

193. holitori numquam supplicat. The inventor of a plot
or plan is often compared by Plautus to a cook or seasoner of
viands : see 209, and ibo intro ut id quod alius condiuz‘t cocus . . .
condiant Cas. ii. 8. 75. A woman who is mala, “ shrewd '³
(which has two senses in Shakspeare, like mala in Plautus), has
no need to go begging to the dealer in the materials wherewith
to “ brew mischief '’; she has a plentiful supply of them about
her (domi). The materials of the cocus would be holera, from
the holz‘tor ; the wornan's are dola· &Q

194. domi: cp. hanc ego de me coniecturam domi facio, ne
quaeram foris Cist. ii. Ι. 2 ; coniecturam domi facio magis
quam ex auditis Cas. ii. 3. 8; also domo, as z'd nunc experior
domo atque z'pflz de me scio Amph. ii. 2. 5. So Cicero, domi est
Att. x. 143 domopetes Fam. vii. 25. [So in Cat. xxxi. 13. 14, Ι
think we should read Gaudete, uosque Zudz’ae lacus undae Ι ridete
quidquid est domi cachinnorum, “ rejoice, ye waves of the lake,
and smile all the smiles ye have'’ (literafly, “have about you,
keep a stock 0f”). In lxiv. 274 cachinnus = “the ripple of a
wave.'' Perhaps Scaliger’s ludz'ae might be defended by com-
paring (pessuli)fite causa mea ludii barbari Cur. i. 2. 62. Or„
perhaps (Lydiae being retained) lacus was possibly feminine
(and then we could read lacus for palas in Hor. A. P. 65);
in that case lacus would stand in agreement with Lydiae in the
genetive.]

199. contra, an adverb, “in retaliation '': see on 101.
201. illuc = illud, neuter from illic = ille.

202. fronte: see on 18.
curans cogitans: see on 137.

203. pultat, “knoeks at the door of his breast.'’
cor, “intelligence ἐ see 336, 783, and cordate 1088. So
