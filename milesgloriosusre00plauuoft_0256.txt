162 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

esurio, non tihi Capt. iv. 2. 86. For egfi, cp. Amph. i. 1. 44;
so modo sometimes has the last syllable long, and immo always.
There are many places (e. g. Capt. v, 4. 24; Cist. iV. 2. 80;
Pseud. i. 3. 37; Epid. iii. 4. 17) where ego should be held to
have the last long, though Muller and others would in these
cases alter the text.

238. ut . . . dicam, “by saying”: see on 188.

239. aduenisse followed by dative is not same as adu.

ad aliquem. Here Plzz'l. is the dat. commodi; tr. “Phil. has
her twin-sis'ter on a visit.”

240. lacte, old form of lac which is not found in Plautus.

lactist = lactis est, as rest: res est, &c. In two places
(Men. V. 9. 30, Amph. ii. 1. 54) the mss give lacti, but in both
cases lactis is read by R„ who maintains that similis, consimilis,
dissimilis, never take a dative in the comic poets. There is a

parallel Greek proverb quoted by Cic. Att. iv. ὃὸ. 2, σύκῳ μὰ
τὴν Δήμητρα σῦκον οὐδὲ ἓν Ι οὕτως ὅμοιον γέγονεν.

242. ut . . . arguam, “by proving,” as ut dz'cczm, 238.
illic: see on 122.

concriminatus sit. Sit has its original quantity3 concrimi-
natus is ἅπ. εἶρ. Plautus affects strange words compounded
with con, as condzgnus, 505; cmffuturum, 941; concasligare

Trin. i. Ι. 3; consuadet ii. 4. 1263 confulgeo Amph. v, 1. 15;
condecet Truc. ii. 1. 16.

243. cum alieno oscularier: cp. amplexari cum in 245;
and conqueritur meeum, 125 ; &postulare tecum 525; we find in
Plautus, orare, postulare, cum alz'quo osten; and mentionem
facere cum aliquo Cist. i. 2. 15; Aul. iv, 7. 3; so perdere (and
seruare) fidem, cauere, pignus dare, mutuom facere, experiri,
captare, iudicem (arbitr-mn) capere, cum aliquo.

248. doctum, “ clever‚’' as osten in Plautus.

250. quid agimus, a more emphatic way of speaking than
quid agamus ; so qm'dago .· see 449 and note. This too is among
the colloquialisms of Cicero's Letters : see Att. xvi. 7. 4, nunc
quid respondemus.

trecentae. The number more commonly used in Latin to ex-
press an indefinite number: μυρίοι, “a thousand‚’' is sescenti,
which we have in an exactly similar passage to this Trin. iii.
3. 62; we have also ducenti in this sense, and even quingenti
