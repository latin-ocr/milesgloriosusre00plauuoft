d and cl in cursive mss3 thus we find dibeo for clipeo,
dicenlam for clz'enlam, danculum for clanculum. He
is called Pleusicles, probably, in allusion to his dis—
guise as a nauclerus. We meet a Pleusidippus in
the Rudens. Sceledrus is, probably, so called that a
play may be made on scelus, as is done in 289, 330,

notes on 842. For the termination of Milphidippa,
