at least the significant part of that passage correctly. I believe
therefore that in Capt. ii. 3. 78 we should read with Lind.fac
fidele (= fideliter) sis fidelis. Fidele (= fideliter) fidelis is of
course thoroughly Plautine: cp. firme firmus, misere miser,
inpudenter inpudens, sapienter sapere &c- Again, celere is
undoubtedly an adverb in Cur. ii. 3. 4, and probably in Ter.
Ph. 179, though in the former passage editors have sought to
make celere an adjective by reading properum sor propere, or
subitum for subito. Quite similar is the use of insanum for in-
sane in 24, above; insanum malum Trin. iii. 2. 473 insanum
magnum Bacch. iv. 5. 1 ; insanum bona Most. iii. 35; and in-
sanum ualde uterque deamat Nervol. Fr. 7. Nonius also
quotes immane for immaniter.

Athenis Atticis. This epithet of Athens is found alsoin
Epid. iii. 4. 46; Truc. ii. 6. 16; Rud. iii. 4. 36; Pseud. i. 5. 2.
It is, no doubt, merely conventional, and cannot have been used
to distinguish the celebrated Athens from other towns so called
in Boeotia and Euboea.

101. eontra, always an adverb in Plautus, Terence, and old
dramatists (so iuxta, see 234), It means (Ι) “ opposite, vis-a-
vis” (123); (2) “reciprocally '' (as here); (3) “in return, reta·
liation” (199); (4) ‘⁴ on the contrary’' (243). It is very fre-
quent with amare, deperire, &c., in the sense which it bears
here. As language grows older adverbs acquire prepositional
usage; for instance, coram is only an adverb in Cicero, though
afterwards generally a preposition. In mz‘lzz· contra adstitit
Capt. iii. 5. 6, milzz' is the ethical dative.

102. legatus fuit = legatus est, very common in Plautus;
so »ἔξ find fueram for eram of the pluperfect passive, fuero for
ero c.

103. magnai: see on 84.

T 104. interibi for interim ; often in Plautus but not found iu
erence.

105. insinuat sese ad. This phrase is found again in
cist. i. 1. 91, and without se ibid. 94, inde in amicitiam insinu-
auit cum matre et mecum simul.

108. itaque, ‘¹ and so ’' : see 1410; itaque seems some-
times to = ita, especially in the emphatic sense of ita: “so
much, so true is it that '' : e. g. itaque omnis exegy'tsorm = ita
Aul. iii. 1. 7 ; itaque detondebo = ita det. Bacch. ii. 3. 8.
