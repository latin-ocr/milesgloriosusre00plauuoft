INTROD UCTION. xxxi

edition, for it was made in the earlier half of the
15th century, probably (says Teuffel) by order of
Alfonso I. of Naples; and represents nothing
more than the authority of the scholars who con-
structed it. It abounds in conjectures—some good,
some wretched; the emendations are very arbitrary;
the editors (as they may be called), one of whom
was probably Francis Poggio, had hardly any know-
ledge of Plautine prosody, and they remove his
metrical irregularities whenever an easy conjectural
emendation presents itself‚ but allow them to stand
when they do not seem easily corrected.

1472, represents almost the same text as F, and has
proved, therefore, a great stumbling·block to the
earlier editors of Plautus, who were not aware of the
worthlessness ofthe so-called ms on which it was no
doubt founded. An interesting exemplification of
the way in which FZ misled the early edd. will be
had by referring to my critical foot-note on v. 50, and
at the same time the paramount value ofA in Plautino
criticism will be illustrated. The verse in M ran ε

at peditas telu quia erant si uiuerent.

F gave, evidently by a conjecture:
at pedites relliquiae erant si uiuerent ;

hence the earlier edd„ even to Weise :

at peditatus relliquiae erant, si uiuerent.

This verse was supposed to mean “ yet they were but
the refuse of the infantry if they were suffered to sur-
vive‚'' which is, of course, neither good sense nor
good Latin. Comparing this with the reading of A
as testified to by ffludemund, At pedz'laslelliquia erant
siuz' uiuerent, we at once see how different is the

value of M (i. e. BCD) and FZ3 M only divided the
