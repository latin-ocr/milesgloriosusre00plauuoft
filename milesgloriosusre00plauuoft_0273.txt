NOTES. 173

deceiving you ?); hence te uideo = “I believe you.’' So taceas.-
me spectes, “dont say a word; trust me” (see if Ι look as if 1
would let him off) As. iii. 3. 90; reddam ego te ex fera fame

mansuetam: me specta modo, “trust me for that” As. i.
2. 19.

377. nisi: see on 24.

379. fenestra. Fenastra occurs thrice in Pl. and once in
Ter. Festus and Macrobius say that festra was the old form of
the word; but whether it was so written or only so pronounced
it is impossible to decide. Sometimes movable shutters were
used to close the windows, as is proved by the movable frames
found beside the windows of the house of the “Tragic
Poet,” at Pompeii: in other cases thin tablets of clay served
this purpose, of which, also, several specimens have been
preserved at Pompeii: we further hear of a transparent
stone (lapis specularis) being used; and window panes of
artificial glass have been found at Pompeii (Guhl δε Koner
366). Bars or lattice were also used for the same purpose,
as appears from this passage. The windows were small

and few, and were chiefly on the second storey. Glass became
common under the Empire.

nam, the ellipse is (yet she was not where she now is all
along) “ for I surely saw her in here.”

380. intendere, “to persist in.'’
erg-o: see on 59.

381. noctu here = nocte, generally an adverb. conversely
we find nox as an adv. = noctu in As. iii. 3. 7 ; so sz' nox-furtum
faxsit xii. Tabb. ς sz' lucz· sz' nox Ennius ap. Prisc. : cp. pernox.
Hac noctu = “ last night‚’' so τῆσδε νυκτός.

382. aduortito. She addresses Pal. only, see 370, 371.
38 5. hospitio huc deuerti, “ came here on a visit.”

386. Palaestrionis . . . narratur. Pal. says aside, “My
own dream (i. e. the dream Ι invented myself) is being told
me,” then aloud “ Proceed!”; there is, perhaps, an allusion to
the proverb τούμὸν ὄνειρον ἐμοί (meaning “you're telling me
what I know already''), quoted by Cic. Att.vi. 9. 3.

391. illa: see on 122.
