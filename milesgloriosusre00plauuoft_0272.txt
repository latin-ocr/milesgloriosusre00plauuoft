363. lubet: sc. perire. praepropere is not found elsewhere
in Pl. The prefix of prae· to adjectives and adverbs is not
frequent in PL, and is, indeed, characteristic more of the post·
Classical, than the ante-classical and classical periods. We have,
however, praeclarus below, 1042, praepotens Poen. v. 4. 9, both
which words are also found in Attius, who also has praefer-
uz'dus,· praemature occurs in Most. ii. 2. 69, praematurus and

praeualidus in Afranius, praegrandis in Pacuvius.

364. bonus, ironical, as often in Pl. : cp. χρηστός.

probri, especially applied to unchastity in women: cp.
Amph. i. 2. 153 Aul. i. 1. 36.

365. em tibi. “There he is for you'' ; em is another form
osen (acc. of dem. pron. is), and is quite different from hem, an
emotional interjection, expressive either of sorrow or joy. Em
not hem should be read with imperatives, like uide, specta, tene,
accz'gbe, serua ,· em serua, “take that,’' constantly betokens in

Pl. the infliction of a blow.

368. atque. “aye‚’' a corroborative force common in atque
adeo·

credo, “ you’ll lose them, I’m thinking '⁵ ; so in 203, and Ep. i.
1. 323 it is sometimes distinetly ironieal, as in credo misericors
est Amph. i. 1. 141.

370. stulta et mora : cp. more hoc fit atque stulte Stich. v.
1. Ι. Sum is understood; a common ellipse in Pl.

371· eapitis perdam. On the analogy of capitis accusare,
damnare ,· the phrase occurs again in As. i. 2. 6, Bacch. in'.

3. 86.

73. maiores. A slave was nullo patre in Roman law3 hence
the joke of the long enumeration of ancestors. Siti = ‘⁶ buried‚’'
siti dicuntur ii qui conditi sunt. The poorer persons were
generally buried‚ not burned (Guhl and Koner, 591).

374. hisce : see on 40.

375. te uolo : sc. conloqui. This very common ellipse is made

the basis of a joke in Pseud. i. 3. 20, Iuppiter te perdat quisquis
es. Te uolo. At uos ego ambos, where te uolo and at uos ego
ambos (uolo) are ambiguous, and may mean either te uolo (conlo-

qui), or te uolo (Iuppiter perdat).
376. me uide. “ You may trust me’'[(d0 I look as if I were
