The mss of the Miles, of the readings of which a
record is given in the critical notes, are :—

(1). B, the codex vetus of Camerarius, a cursive ms
of the 1 rth century. It contains all the extant plays.
It was discovered by Camerarius in the middle of the⁴
16th century. It is now in the Vatican.

(2). C, the codex decurtatus of Camerarius, now at
Heidelberg. It is also cursive, and was written in
the rzth century. It contains only the last twelve
plays. It should be explained that when one speaks
of the first eight plays of Plautus one means Amphi·
truo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi, Casina, Cistella-
ria, Curculio, Epidicus; and the last twelve are
Bacchides, Menaechmi, and the remainder in alphabe-
tical order. The plays follow each other in the mss
in alphabetical order, the only exception being the
Bacchides, where the chronological order has been
substituted for the alphabetical.

(3). D, the codex Ursinianus or Vaticanus, a cursive
ms of the 1zth century. Early in the 15th century it

> was brought from Germany by one Nicholas ofTreves

to Cardinal Orsini at Rome, by whom it was lodged
in the Vatican, where it now is. It contains the
last twelve plays of Plautus, with the Amphitruo, Asi-
naria, Aulularia, and half the Captivi (to iii. 2. 4).
This ms was for a long time the only authority
