PR EFA OE

dealing with the text of the Miles Gloriosus appeared
in the Rhez'nz‘sclzes Museum (vol. xl„ pp. 521-562)›
from the pen of Th. Birt of Marburg. Iadd here
some of his most remarkable comments. None of
them seem to me particularly valuable. However, I
warmly agree with him in his rejection of stragem for
fartum in line 6-

Quae misera gestit fartum facere ex hostibus,

which has been so universally accepted by recent
German editors (except Ussing). 1 am glad to find
Α that Birt defends fartum, as 1 do, on the ground of
the alliterative character of the passage, as well as
the vis comica of the scene :—“Welehe echt komische
Bravade! Zu Fiillsell zerhacken will das Schwert
den Feind! Die Alliteration sichert diese Vermu-
thung.”

Some of his conjectures are, to say the least, un·
necessary. For instance, in 11—

Neque aequiperare suas virtutes ad tuas,

Birt reads Attalus for the plainly sound ad tuas,
comparing Poen. 111. 3. 51 (663), and many places
in Plautus which allude to Darius, th'lzppus, and
Antiochus. More to be commended is his proposal
to read unicam for z‘n vicem in 150—

Et mox ne erretis haec duarum hodie in vicem
Et hinc et illinc mulier feret imaginem.

Unicus = unus is frequent in Plautus, ag. Stich. 3 5¹.
