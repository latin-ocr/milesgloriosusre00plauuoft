NOTES. 171

in them—1⁹11 make them mistresses of lmavery, and keep an
abundant supply for myself over and above '’ 3 literally, ‘⁴ out of
that which is superfluous in myself alone (without going to any-
one else to eke it out).’' For the ellipse of the antecedent ex co
before quod, cp. 691, 1077, 11563 quod te misi (sc. de eo ob
quod) Cur. ii. 3. 483 dare mercedem qui (sc. ez* qui) iv. 4. 343
quod bene fecz'stz'(sc. ob z'd quod) Capt. v. 1. 20 ; quod ego fatear
pudeat v. 2. 83 quod male feci crucior v. 3. 19.

356. solae = soli: cp. eae 348, aliae 8023 so istae, alterae ,·
we also find ulli, uni, nulli, isti as genetive.

357. nunciam is not nunc iam, but manci-am. It is related
to nunc (originally nuncz‘, cp. nuncine Ter. Andr. iv. Ι. 59) as
quoniam to quom <originally quoni), and etiam to et ,· we find
the same am in quispiam, palam, coram, clam.

procul, not “to a distance‚’' but “a little way 0ff‚” as in
quoia uox sonat procul Cur. i. 2. 18; oboluit Casina procul

Cas. iv. 3. 21 : see below, 1169.

358. quid. ais tu. “I say.” This phrase bespeaks atten-
tion in Pl.; literally‚ “what have you to say (to the remark
I am going to make?”) flam· rem gero is “you see I am mind-
ing my business.’' Sc. stands before the door with his arms
spread out to prevent the passing of anyone. Hence the joke of
Pal. in next verse.

359. extra portam, probably the Esquiline, the abode of
the carnzfices, vespillones, and coriarii, where was the burying-
ground of the poor, and where executions took place. The
allusion to a gate of Rome, though the scene is laid in Ephesus,
is quite consistent with Plautine habit. So we find frequent
allusions to T resuiri, Aediles, and Praetors ,· and Lyco, a banker
of Epidaurus, is made to do obeisance to Aesculapius capite
operto (Cur. iii. 3. 19), a distinctly Roman and non-Greek cus-
tom (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 10).

360. dispessis, from dispendo for dz'spando (cp. perpetior
and patior). This verb occurs in the form dz‘spenno in 1407.
Slaves were forced to carry through the city the cross on which
they were to be executed.

nam quam = quamnam.
361. quis, feminine in old Latin; so quem, quisquis, quis·-

quam, quemquam, quemuis, quempiam, quisque, quemque are
all used as feminine.
