ACT IV.—SCENE II.

992. quasi: cp. 797.
993. ecquid, “at all’': cp. 1106, 1111.

994, 5. ecquis . . . suo, “ Is there any one here to pry into
my doings, who concerns himself with other people's business,
who lives at his own charges (and, therefore, not having to look
after his own affairs, has plenty of time to devote to other
people's) ?'' This passage is usually rendered unintelligible by
corrupt ms readings, curet and uiuat. I have corrected these.
They were, no doubt, assimilated to the mood of aucupet—a
very common error of copyists. Vesperi is the evening meal,
and qui de uesperi uiuit suo is one who can live on his own
resou1·ce5‚ and therefore has the more time for busying himself
about other people’s affairs. Cp. a very similar passage, and
one which throws much light. on this, Truc. i. 2. 40, 41· —

A. Nimis otiosum te arbitror hominem esse. D1. Quianam arbitrare?
A. Quia tuo uestimento et cibo alienis rebus curas.

So that quz dc uesperi ui'mt suo means pretty much the same as
otiosus homo. If we read curet and uzuat it would be necessary
to translate, “Is there anyone here to pry into my affairs, to
concern himself with other people’ s business, to live at his own
charges?'' which obviously runs counter to the meaning of the
passage.

of the mistress, the llIz'les says that he “begins to feel a fancy
for her.'’ “What‚'’ says Pal„ “before you’ve seen her ?''
“ Oh, '' replies the Alz'les, “it is all the same as ifI were looking
at her, so completely do I trust your account of her. More?
