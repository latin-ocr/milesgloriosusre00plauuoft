words wrongly, gave telu for -telli, and omitted one ot>
two identical syllables in juxtaposition in sz'VI vnce-
rent (this I call lz'pography in my notes3 its converse
is dittography); telu meant nothing and could mis-
lead no one3 but F sought to get sense out of the
words, and, by introducing relliquiae, misled all edd.
prior to Ritschl. The great importance ofA will be
seen everywhere in my critical notes: when we have
its evidence we should rarely look beyond it. But
M, too, is very valuable, chiefly by reason of the
ignorance of the copyists, which prevents them as a
rule from indulging in conjectures. However, they
sometimes seem to have known just enough Latin to

ι lead them into error; for instance, in v. 1262, uideres

pol sz' amares, B gives the words uidere spolia mares,
words which have a meaning, but one utterly alien to
the context. A does not divide the words at all3 and
we may suppose that similar was the exemplar used
by the copyist ofB; seeing before him VIDERESPOLSI-
AMARES, he divided it carelessly uidere spolsia mares,
then knowing that spolsz‘a was not a Latin word, he
corrected it to spolia, the word nearest to it in form.
Very many cases like this may be seen by referring
to the critical notes. As a rule, however, M gives
the right letters (subject to the adverse influences of
dittography, lz'pography, and ableply) ; but the division
of the words is nearly always perversely wrong.

In the ms B the different characters are indicated
by letters of the Greek alphabet. Thus the charac-
ter who appears first is called A throughout. the
character who appears next is called B, and so on.
In the Trz'nummus and in the plays of Terence the
letter Ω is prefixed to the word “Plaudite.'’ This
probably designates merely the actor who left the
stage last. CANTOR is usually inserted before the
word plaudite in the editions, because Horace, A. P.
155, has the words donec cantor ‘ uos plaudz'te’ dicat.
