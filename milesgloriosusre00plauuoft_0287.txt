NOTES. 187

606. re, “The very things which you meant to do to them,
they actually do to you.” There is an antithesis between uolu-
:nti and νε. For νε, cp. nam de te neque νε neque uerbis merui
ut faceres quod facis Aul. ii. 2. 45 ; rem (actual experience)
potiorem uideo (sc. uerbis) ἰν. 7. 12 ; llaec res agetur nobis uobzs
sabula Capt. prol. 52 ; aut consolando aut consilio aut νε z'uuero
Ter. Heaut. i. 134; res, aetas, usus Ter. Ad. v. 4. 2. So non
νε sed opinione Cic. N. D. iii. 53. Re, which is not found in
the mSS‚ no doubt was omitted through inadvertence, as it im-
mediately follows a word ending with νε, namely, facere: cp.
a very similar passage in Truc. iv. 4. 24, factum cupio; mm νε
facere si uelim non est locus. See also u. ou 341.

608. Metaphors from the chase are common in Pl. ι see 268,

609. ultumam has only spatial‚ not temporal, signification in
Pl. and Ter. ; probe strengthens sterilis, as it strengthens medi-
tatam in 904 and acutus in 1397; it is also used ironically, as
pulcre (see on 404). For the position of probe as far as possible
from the word to which it refers, cp. 1348 and Capt. ii. 3, 95, at
etiam dubitaui hosce homines emerem an non emerem diu.

611. imperium in also occurs Men. v. 7. 413 Pers. iii. 1.

613. utibilius. Vtibz'lz's is frequent in PL, but occurs only
once in Ter. (Phorm. iv. 4. 10) ; the double comparative is very
common in Pl. ; 50 also aeque and adaeque with the compara-
tive: see on 552.

614. immo, “No but, what do you think?'’ Pal. indicates

615. meus, “ after my own heart”: see on 334.

commode, “ rightly, suitably‚ tastesully”: see 6423 so com-
modiorem mitioremque Cic. Q. Fr. i. 1. 39. Commodus with
sums of money means “ of full weight,'’ “current coin of the
realrn.” Commodo and commodum mean ‘⁵ opportunely.’'
