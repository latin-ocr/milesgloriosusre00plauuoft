N OTES. 137

de rimis in Amph. i. 1. 212 may be rendered much more
neat y:

M. Aduenisti‚ audaciai columen, consutis dolis.
S. Immo equidem tunicis consutis huc aduenio, non dolis.

Μ. “ You have come, you—you height of audacity, with your tissue of
S. “Nay,llegome with no tissue of lies, but tissue of good cloth.”

5. mihi ethical dat.

6. lamentetur: cp. 1031, where, as here, the verb denoting
the external expression of grief is put before the verb denoting
the internal sensation; we have aedes lamentariae = “ house of
mourning'’ in Capt. i. 1. 28.

7. quia. Quia, not quod, is used by Plautus aster verbs of
feeling; cp. 1328. ΒΧ recognises only one case of quod, namely,
ne miremini quod non triumpho Bacch. iv. 9. 150. We have,
however beat quod Mil. 468. Conversely, wc have once in Cic.
the Plautine auia in reprehendis me quia defendam Suu. 50.
Eam would De regular ; but se makes the phrase more vigorous:

‘⁶ me iampridem feriatam gestitat '’ would be the very words of
the sword’s wail.

8. misera cp. 801, 1199. Fartum facere is ‘⁴ to make
mincemeat of''; fartum is properly “stuffing”; cp. Most. i. 3.
13 non vestem amatores amant mulieris sed uestis fartum;
hence the minced meat of which sausages are made. R, followed
by all recent German editors, reads stragem for fartum on the
very uncertain authority of Glossaria Vetera, explaining ‘ strages
σωρὸς νεκρῶν.’ But there is no evidence that this gloss refers to
this passage, where the mss. do not preserve a trace of stragem,
and give either fartum or an obvious corruption of it. Surely
>the alliteration with facere more than accounts for the use by
a comic poet of a word in a peculiar sense—a sense, too,
strongly defended by the passage quoted from the Mostellaria,

and possibly paralleled by qui farcit below, 691, on which
passage consult Comm.

9. ubi hie, “ whereabout here”: cp. 1258 ; ubi tu hic habitas

{Rugii iv. 3. 953 quaero in lzis regionibus ubz' habitet Trin. iv.

10. fortem often means “fine, braw'¹ in Plautus: cp. 1066;
ced Bacchis etiam fortis tibi uz'sast Bacch. ii. 2. 385 Nonius

explains fortis as formosus, perhaps not quite accurately; he
