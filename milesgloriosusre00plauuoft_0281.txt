(as) uncertain whether Ι ought to argue out the matter with
you—or whether, if this stranger is really not Phil„ and I have
not seen Phil. at all, you would rather expect that Ι should
apologise to you—I am, I say, as ignorant of this as Ι am un-
certain what Ι saw.'' Istaec is the hospita, haec is Phil. Ι have
translated the passage in accordance with the explanation of Bx,
who takes ut nesciam and sicut nescio closely together. This,
however, would be a very complicated expression, and hardly
suited to the easy flow of Pl. dialogue. It would be simpler, Ι
think, to take sicut etiam nunc nescio quid uiderim separately
from the soregoing words, rendering sicut by some such phrase
as “ that is,” ‘⁴ Ι mean‚'' “ even still, Ι mean, I don’t know what
1 saw.'’ Sicut is used quite in this sense in Men. iv. 2. 20, sicut
me hodie nimis sollicitum cluens quidam habuz't,· so in Poen. iii.
1. 3 ; v. 4. 21 ; Most. ii. 1. 34. In all these places sicut is used
to develope, elucidate, or illustrate a foregoing preposition, as
Langen (p. 249) has clearly shown. See note on 974, where
this same view of the meaning of sicut is used to explain a very
difficult passage. Aequom siet and an uidetur aequius (and in-
deed the construction itself, ut nesciam an uidetur) will seem
very strange to a novice in Plautine usage. But there are
instances of this usage too numerous and too unmistakeable to
admit of emendation, and certainly not to be explained as indi-
cating subtle shades of difference in meaning: e. g. nescis quid
te instet boni Ι neque quam tibi Fortuna faculam lucrifera adlu-
cere uolt Pers. iv. 3. 45; rem uide quae sim et quae fui ante
Most. i. 3. 42; scio qua me ire oportet et quo uenerz'm noui
locum Most. iv. 2. 533 eloquere . . . et quid tibi est et quid uelis
Cist. i. 1. 59. In these and like cases it is idle to seek for a
difference in meaning corresponding to the differeuce in mood;
and emendation is quite out of place. It has been laid down
that indirect interrogations are put in the ind. when the question
is rhetorical, as audin tu ut deliramenta loquitur Men. v„ 5. 21 ;
but in the subj. when the question is a real one, as non scis quis
ego sz'm ‚2 Men. ii. 2. 235 yet in Men i. 3. 24 we have scin quid
uolo when the question is apparently not rhetorical. So in sen·
tences where a verb of seeing, feeling, has forits object a sen-
tence beginning with an interrogative, the ind. and subj. are
used indifferently; cp. uidete . . . quid potest pecunia Stich. iii.
1. 9, with uidete quam mz'lzz' ualde placuerit Merc. 1023 and
scio quid dz'ctura’s Aul. ii. 1. 52, with scio quid siet rei Men. v.
2. 14. The fact seems to be that there is often in PL, owing
to the carelessness of his dialogue‚ a halting between direct and
indirect regimen, as in dic mihi uerum serio: Ecquis alius
