1. 20. The slaves in Latin Comedy jest on their punishments‚
just as in modern argm‘, “to dance upon nothing’' = “to be
hanged '' ; etarnuer dans le sac = “to be guillotined.”

185. nisi depends on an ellipse: “I have given the order
[and so I will go], unless you have any further commands.’‘
Per. could not, however, have “given the order,’' for he has
not left the scene: hence nuntiabo in 196. This scene is
carelessly written3 it is very unnatural that Per. and Pal. should
waste so much time in talk at such a critical moment.

186. profecto is found in four places in Plautus, where there
is no reason to suspect the text of corruptness—(I) here; (2) 280:
(3) Pseud. i. 2. 673 (4) Poen. iv. 2. 85. Proficto is found
passim. Hence Ribbeck substitutes porro in these four places,
and Fl. ingeniously suggests carga, which is explained by the
word profecto in Paul. Fest. 37. The shortening of the penult

' may, however, be accounted for by the fact that the word was so

very much in use; and, probably, if all the passages where it
occurs were examined, it would be found that it should much
oftener be regarded as short.

187. earumque, taken out of muliebri: cp. 753, and non
matronarum officiumst sed meretm'cium Cas. iii. 3. 22.

abstineat, se. (ut ne) abstineat .· cp. abst. inuidere Cur. i. 3.
24; so Suet. Tib. 23. Abstinere takes (Ι) accusative, as absti-
nere manum, amorem 13093 (2) ablative, as abstinere censione
Aul. iv. 1. 15; (3) abstinere aliquem aliqua re below, 6443
Amph. iii. 2. 45 ; (4) it is followed by the infiffitive, as here.

188. ut . . . uincat. “ By outsaeing him from having seen
the woman he saw.” So quem ad modum? ut mz'lzz' des
Pers. i. Ι. 36; haud decorum . . . facis . . . ut inuideas Aul. ii.
2. 43 : cp. tu me alienabis numquam quin noster siem Amph. i.
1. 242. Eat and habeat also depend on ut, and must be ren·

dered “ by denying, by having.’'
190. os, ‘⁴ impudence.''

linguam, “ glibness.' ’

malitiam, ‘⁶ shrewdness.’' Malus = “ shrewd '’ in Plautus:
see below, 193, 350, 880, 1141.

191. confirmitatem. ἅπαξ εἰρημένον = “obstinacy.'’
