190 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

643. ero, ‘¹ Ι shall be found to be⁷’: see instances of this
usage in latter part of note on 395.

644. abstinere me: see on 187. Commodo = ‘⁶ duly.”

646. meam partem: cp. maiorem partem 94 and 7643 so
meam uicem Pl. ; lzumanam uicem Hor.

oratio, “ right (turn) to speak ”; these verbals are very com-
mon in Pl, and they take the case of the verb from which they
come; the verbal exitzo, which occurs in Truc. ii. 6. 30, is very
rashly expelled from Capt. iii. 3. 4, where it governs exitium;
exzre takes an accus. in Pl„ as in 1432.

647. For the asyndeton, cp. tmbas lites As. iv. 2. 5 3 miseriis
laboribus Men. v. 9. 74; dolos perfidias Pseud. ii. 1. 7; donis
hostiis Rud. 23. So Lucr. has proelia pugnas edere ii. 118. So
also in Pl. we find gratis gratias, armis arte duellica, fictorcon-
ditor, uentus turbo, congrum muraenam. The same asyndeton
in adjectives is to be observed in 663 and 952 below; and in
dubiis egenis Capt. ii. 3. 46; piscatu probo electili Most. iii. 2.
41 ; oratione uz'nnula uenustula As. i, 3. 70.

648. eumquam, old form of umquam ‚· sc. cubi, cunde, cus-
que, cusquam, cuspium, for ubi&e. ; alicubi: ali-cubi, not aliqu-
ubi, and sicubi = „vi-cubi. R has introduced these old forms
into certain passages of PL, where hiatus seemed to indicate
their original existence.

651. odiosus: see on 427.

sermonem segrego, ‘⁶ break off the conversation”; so
segrega sermonem Poen. i. 2. 139. There is a ὕστερον πρότερον
in abeo domum, sermonem segrego.

652. uenerem, “charm of manner’': cp. Stich. ii. 2. 5,
amoenitatis omnium ueneram. So uenerio, uenustatis 655, 6.

6 5 3. Aminulae, ‘⁶ A minula urbs paruarum opum fuit in Apu-
lia” Fest. Paul. 25. Per. says he was born in Ephesus, not
Apulia. It seems from Cas. prol. 72 that Apulia had acquired
a certain amount of Hellenism ; so that Per. here means to say,
“ my Hellenism is pure, not an uncouth imitation.''

654. See crit. note.

655. atque equidem. This, not atque quidem, is the phrase
in Pl.; so quando equidem, not quando quidem. It has been
shown above that it is a mistake to suppose that equidem can
