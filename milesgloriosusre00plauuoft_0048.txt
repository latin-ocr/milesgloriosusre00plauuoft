These rules account for 90 per cent. of the in·
stances of long vowels shortened by Pl. The re-
maining instances coming under the heading A will
be accounted for by one of the following rules :—
(a') s may be always omitted in Plautine scansion,
e. g. saluos sis, estis nunc, ludificalfcs sit. This license
is of course familiar to students of early Latin. It
occurs once in Catullus, osten in Lucretius, Luci-
lius, &c., and three times in one verse of Ennius—

Tum lateralis dolor certissumus nuntius mortis.

(β’) Ancient inscriptions testify to the fact that in
early Latin certain final consonants were dropped in
very common words: sor apud quidem parum soror
caput dedit enim we find apu quide paru soro capu dedi
enl-

(γ’) Words in very common use, such as ille, iste,
unde, inde, nempe, esse, ecce, ergo, projecto, lose the
length of the penult.; indeed ille sometimes vanishes
in elision. Trisyll. exclamations, as edepol, are often
treated as dissyll.

(δ’) With instances of long vowels shortened may
be classed the fact that in early Latin a syll. natu-
rally short cannot be lengthened by standing before
a mute and a liquid. Hence the verse

si salsa dices, Lucrio‚ excruciabere
cannot be matutine, and has been corrected by the
change of Luc-rso into Lurcz'o.

* The rule operates even when the last long syll. of the
bacchius is resolved, as in amor misericordia, Ter. Andr. i. 5. 26.
