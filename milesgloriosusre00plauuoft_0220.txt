ARGUMENTI.

3. peregre means in Plautus (a) “to a foreign land”;

b‘) ‘from a foreign land'’ ;(c)‘ ‘in a foreign land,'’ when it
should be written peregrzss the word is an old locative‚ origi-
nally peregrez' (Corssen, i. 776). The thi1d was its original mean-
ing. Other adverbs having two meanings in Plautus are-
(1 nusquam, which means no whzther as well as no where,-
(2 so usquam, cp. Most. iii. 2. 172, haud usquam abscedam,-
(3 z',ntus which means (α )wz'',tlzzn (b) from wz'ffthzn but does
not, like peregre, ever convey the sense of motion to; zntus
cannot: intro (eo intus et intro sum soloecismi sunt, Quintil. i.
5. 50)· , therefore zmmo intus potius sequere hac me As. v. 2.
90 is certainly corrupt.

4. eidem. Ez'hasthree metricalvalues inPlautus—(1)sp0ndee,
, as here; (2) iambus, as in 1088: (3) one long syllable, which
is lis usual metrical value. Ei in eidem is generally spondee,
as ere.
6. geminis, an un- -Plautine usage. Plautus uses emznus
only with pater¹ soror, Elius (but Terence has gemmas nuptzas
Andr. 674). ther un· -P autine usages in these two Arguments
are pointed out by Lorenz: (1) rzdzculz's v. 9, sor which Plautus
would have written rz-'nhculariz'sss or ridzculz's modis (we find,
however ri'dzculc causi'z‘ Arnph 111. 2. 36; and per rzdiculum
, Truc. ii. 2. 8); rz'',dzculus masc. sing. and plur., always means
Q& (2) poenas-lgc-zf, v. 14, for poe enas pendere,— sufferre. In

the econd Arg ument we have(1)mutu0‚ v. 1, which' 15 not found
before Cicero gand Varro, though we have ²mutuum fit 1242·
Plautus would have used contra, as in 101. (2) subornat, 14, for
which Plautus would have probably written dat, as in 785.
(3) dzmz',ttere 15, would mean in Plautus‘ ‘to allow t’o dispersess’
and can properly be used only of a plurality; Plautus would have
used aszttere Moreover, for oberrans Arg. i. 8, Plautus would
have most probably written ambulans‚· sor omz'ssamfaczat (11)
missam (or amissam) saczat; for deportat (Arg. ii. 4), avehi&
su ”fingzt (11), sz'mulat‚· and for sollzcztandum (13), sublectan':
dum, as in 1066; sollzcz'tare in Plautus means ‘to torment,'
not‘ ‘to cajolel'

8. tegulis. The Roman houses were undetached, with
party walls m common, and the roofs being much more acces-
sible than in modern houses (St. Luke‚ v. 19), it was eas'y to
‘vass from one housetop to another. Id'le slaves seem to have
been fond of srequenting the tegulae and prying into neighbour-
