for instance, the prologues to the Asinaria, Menaechmi,
Casina, pseudulus) 3 but the most definite proof of the
post-Plautine origin of many of the prologues is that
a‹lduced by J. L. Ussingfil‘ namely‚ that many of them
clearly refer to a sitting body of spectators, whereas
we know that in B. c. 154, thirty years after the death
of Plautus, when Cassius Longinus began, in his
censorship, to build a theatre of stone, the senate
prohibited him, and enacted: “ne quis in urbe pro-
piusue passus mille subsellia posuisse sedensue ludos
spectare uellet.’'† In this play the speech of Palae-
strio, which does duty for a prologue, consists of
three parts—(1) 79—87, which was probably part osa
post-Plautine prologue prefixed to the play, and not
spoken by Palaestrio; (2) 88-94, a part of another
alternative prologue used by another company of
actors; (3) 95—155‚ the remains of the original
Plautine speech of Palaestrio.

This is not the only place in which this play bears
traces of incompleteness‚ and of the want of a final
revision. At 185 Periplecomenus says dz‘xz' ego istuc,
though he could not possibly have communicated
with Philocomasium, because he has not lest the
stage—a fact which he recognises when he says nun·
lz'aho in 196. Moreover‚ it is most unnatural that at
such a critical moment Periplecomenus and Palaes-
trio should waste so much time on general reflections
on the female sex, instead of at once apprising Phi-
locomasium of her danger. Again, from 600—765
the action of the piece absolutely stops while Peri-
plecomenus, hardly interrupted by an occasional
exclamation from Pleusicles and Palaestrio, indulges
in a very prolix, though very elever, diatribe on the
