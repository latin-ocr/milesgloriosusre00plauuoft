N OTES. 161

recipere . . . dicis: sc. dicis te recepturum esse ad te,
“That you will take this on yourself, undertake it.'’ Verbs
of promising, hoping, &c., are osten followed by present
infinitzbe, not future z'nfinitz've in Plautus, e. g. promisi dare,
minatur sese abire, adiurat se monstrare, me inferre Veneri
uouz'. This usage is also found in Terence, and is one of the
colloquialz'sms which Cicero in his Letters has borrowed from
the stage, or rather from the conversation ofevery-day life, which
is reproduced on the stage.

230, 231 : see crit. note.
231. impetrare = sc. te impetraturum esse.

232. auden = uin = “won't you ? ” sodes (si audes) = sis ,-
non audes mihi subuenire As. ii. 4. 7o= “ won’t you help me ?‘’
The verb is, no doubt, connected with auidus.

quod, sc. eo quod ; for participare is followed by abl.‚· see
part. sermone 262. On the ellipse of the antecedent, see 356,
where the passage was long misunderstood through the overlook-
ing of this usage.

233. regionem: cp. 886, “bring you into the direction of
my plots,'’ i.e. ‘⁴ give you some sort of knowledge how the land
lies in my machinations.”

234. iuxta mecum, “as well as 1,” also in Sall. Cat. 585
iuxta like contra is always an adverb in Plautus, and is always
found with cum: we find pariter, aeque mecum in the same
sense (in one place, iuxta tecum aeque Pers. iv. 3. 83) with
verbs, scire, nescire, tenere, curare.

salua . . . indidem. Metaphor from a deposit‚ which is
more fully expressed in Trin. i. 2. 108, mihi quod credideris·
sumes ubz'posmem.

ειεῗὲἐῃῗιῑξιε . . . suo- “My master is as thick-skinned as an

236. lapis: cp. saxum, 1024.

ego mi istuc scio. By inserting mi, of which there are clear
traces in the mss, Ι have avoided the expedient (usually adopted)
of wntmg sapz'entz'az’for sapientiae, which Ι object to here, not

on account of the genetive form -ai, which is common (see on 84),

but because the line is very unrhythmical as it is given by ΒΧ.

For the phrase, ego mi istuc scio cp. 282, 3313 mi equidem
