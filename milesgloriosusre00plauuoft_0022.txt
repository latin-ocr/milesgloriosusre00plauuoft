PREFA OE

LINE 693.
Flagitiumst, si nil mittetur: quo supercilio spicit.

I have defended quae, which has the authority of
A and BCD and Festus against the quo of FZ, which
had been accepted by all the editors. Ussing, 1 am
glad to see, reads quae, understanding ei, as I sug-
gested. He proposes in his notes quae supercz‘lzkz
inficit, quoting Iuvenal 2, 93, supercilium madida
fulzgrz'ne tinctum. O. Ribbeck also reads quae. I am
Α strongly disposed to accept A. Palmer's suggestion
(Hermathena, V11., p. 145) on this verse. He would
make no change in the text except the change of
supercilio to supercilia or supercilium, and would ren-
der, “it’s a shame if we send no present to the
woman who tells fortunes from the eyebrows.’' He
adds, “spicere with an accusative was, we are told
by Varro, the very form of expression used for divin-
ing by augury: “in auguriis etiam nunc dicunt
avem specere.'’ The eyebrow most likely held the
place with ancient fortune-tellers which the palm
of the hand holds with modern gipsies.”

PE. Edepol qui te de isto multi cupiunt non mentirier.

Professor Ussing will not accept my defence of
non of all the mss. But I am glad to find he does
