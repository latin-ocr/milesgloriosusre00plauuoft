it were applicable at all, and does not (as Ritschl
pointed out) account for the fact that mater andsrater
are not found as monosyllables in Latin Comedy,
though in French they are treated in exactly the
same way as paler peire. The third theory (c), namely
that the early Latin poets often neglected the law
of position, at first seems plausible. But against
the theory that the law of position was neglected by
Plautus there lies this great objection, that it explains
only one of two sets of phenomena which seem to
be closely connected : it would, if true, explain the
shortening of a vowel long by position. but not the
shortening of a vowel long by nature. We corne

We must seek some explanation of his strange
shortening of long syllables whether long by nature
or long by position. And if one theory will serve to
explain all these phenomena, that theory will, of
course, the more recommend itself to our acceptance.
Such a theory was first suggested by the great
Bentley in his schediasma on the metres of Terence,
and this constitutes one of the greatest achieve-
ments of that illustrious scholar, though the treatise,
as the name imports‚ was only a hastily executed
brochum on a subject calling for close and prolonged
observation and research. Bentley observed that
the natural prose accent of the word almost always
coincided with the ictus of the verse; and, to bring
out this more clearly in his edition of Terence, he for
the first time indicated each arsis of the verse by an
acute accent. Bentley, no doubt, pushed his prin·
ciples much too far; and he resorted far too unspar·
ingly to conjecture in the attempt to reduce Terence
to a complete conformity with his rule. But the root of
