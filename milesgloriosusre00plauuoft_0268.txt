‘⁴ Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor ‚³⁷⁹

306. tamen. For tamen, standing in the clause to which it
does not in sense belong, cp. Lucr. v. 1088 (coguntur) muta
tamen quom sint uarias emittere uoces. So ὅμως often.

311. quidquid est, “ come or go what wi11”: cp. quidquid
est errabo potius quam perductet quispiam Most. iii. 2. 160;

(2) emerim, through the very common substitution of r for s
between two vowels.

321. mirumst . . · tritico. “Itis a wonder that you live on
darnel when wheat is so cheap.’' Darnel was bad for the eyes
(Ov. Fast. i. 691). Se. means “you must have been living on
darnel, or your eyes would not serve you so badly.”

tam uili tritico, an abl. of attendant circumstances. Bx
well compares rebus uz'lz'orz'bus multo Ter. Phorm. 795 but
totidem litteris Trin. ii. 2. 65, which also he cites as similar,
