imprisonment of Naevius (212 ff). From this allu-
sion has been deduced an anterior limit for the date

The plot of the play is as follows :—

Pleusicles, a young Athenian, is in love with an
Athenian girl, Philocomasium. During the absence
of Pleusicles on a public mission to Naupactus, Pyr·
gopolinices, the Braggart Captain who gives to the

- play its name, meets Philocomasium at Athens, and

finally succeeds in carrying her off to Ephesus. He
keeps her in his house at Ephesus against her will,
and without the knowledge of her mother. Palaes-
trio, the faithful slave of Pleusicles, determines to
acquaint his master with the abduction of Philoco-
masium, and accordingly he takes ship for Naupac-
tus. The ship is captured by pirates, and Palaestrio
is sent to Ephesus as a present from his captor to
the Miles. He recognises Philocomasium, and they
begin to concert a plan for her deliverance. Pleu—
sicles, on receiving a letter from Palaestrio, comes to
Ephesus, and resides at the house of Periplecomenus,
a hospitable and cultivated old gentleman, a next-
door neighbour of the llsz'les. Periplecomenus heartily
throWs himself into the scheme for restoring Philo-
comasium to her lover. And in the meantime, to
secure their immediate access to each other, they
open a secret door in the party wall which separates
the house of Periplecomenus from the chamber in
the house of the Miles in which Philocomasium is
imprisoned.
