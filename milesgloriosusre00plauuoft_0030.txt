after it is published. For instance, on the verse,
Cur. 317—

os amarum habeo, dentis plenos, lippiunt fauces fame,

Koch elegantly conjectured lacrumarum for os ama·
rum. This was evidentlya step in the right direction,
and it was at once accepted by Lowe, Gotz, and
Scho‘ll, in their new ed. of Ritschl’s Plautus (Cur-
culio, 1879). But there is in the Rheinz'sches Museum
for this year, p. 72, an emendation by Fr. Biicheler,
which bids fair to oust the conjecture of Koch from
· the position which it has just won. For os amarum,
Biicheler reads gramarum, a word which contains
more of the letters of the rns reading than lacruma-
rum, and which most admirably suits the context.
Grama = λήμη is attested by Festus, Nonius, and
several other Grammarians, and is just the word
which would have puzzled the copyist, who would
have recognised a familiar Latin word in the last
letters of gr-amarum, and would have substituted
os by an easy conjecture for the perplexing gr-. On
an important passage, therefore, the Lowe-Go'tz—
Scholl ed. of Ritschl’s Plautus is already antiquated.
Truly the Plautine critic writes in sand.
