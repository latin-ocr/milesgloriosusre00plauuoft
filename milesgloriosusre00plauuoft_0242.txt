an inmate, while pultare, κόπτειν, denote the knocking of one
seeking entrance. But to explain concrepare ψοφεῖν of a tap
given by the outcoming person, to warn passengers that the
door was about to be opened, is quite wrong, sor the following
reasons z—(I) such a practice would be childish and meaning-
less in any case ; (2) 111 private houses the doors always opened
inwards, not outward53 (3) the door, to which concrepare
ψοφεῖν apply, did not give on the street at all, but on a passage
leading to the outer door, which outer door was always open
by day; in Amph. iv. 1. 9, Amph. expresses his surprise that
aedes occluserunt ; so sed quid hoc occlusa ianuast interdius
Most. ii. 2. 14; so Stich. ii. 1. 36. Hence Euclio is always
careful to enj0in the shutting of the door. Fores coner. and
θύρα ψοφεῖ refer to the ereaking made by thesores in opening;
they were hung not on hinges but on pivots (cardines), which
were made of wood, generally elm, and made considerable noise
, when moved (Marquardt Privatalt. i. 233). Hence we find in
Cur. i. 3. 3 that water is used to prevent the sonitum forium et
(repz'tum cardinum ; so also in Ar. Thesm. 487, ἐγὼ δὲ κατα-
χέασα τοῦ στρόφεως ὕδωρ Ι ἐξῆλθον. If the hinge had been iron,
oil, not water, would have been requisite. The terms ostium,
ianua, fores, seem to be used indiscriminately for both the inner
and the outer doors.
