N OTES. 147

87. id. “That Greek term ἇλαζῶν we players translate into
the Latin term glorz’osus.''

89. qui hinc ad forum abiit. These words make it probable
31²? ἐξὲξ ἔξὲξὲζαε, of which 88-94 is a part, was spoken aster

90. stercoreus. ἅπαξ εἷρ. ; but lutum, luteus, and such
words, are common terms of abusein Plautus ε see 325 ; Truc. iv.
ghjlegtiltssost. v. 2. 45. Cp. κόπρειος. Impurus is the Plautine

94. maiorem partem: see 646, and me haud centensu-
mam partem laudat Capt. ii. 3. 61; used of temporal duration
in Poen. i. 3. 4, maiorem partem z'n ore habitas meo.

sauiis, here “lips‚'' generally “ kisses ⁷'; ualgz's sauz'z's is ex-
pssained by Gram. : labris foras uersum tumentibus .· see on 26,
a ove.

95. seruitutem seruio. This figure is common in Plautus;
among the most remarkable examplesare Mil. ?28, 381,u6‘99;
and turbas turbare Bacch. 1v. 10. 13 pzetatem ptare As. 1u. 1.
3; cenam cenare Rud. ii. 6. 24; prandium prandere Poen. iii.
5. 14; also gaudium gaudere Ter. And. v. 5. 8, which is found

between the diction of Cic. Epp. and the Comic stage.

96. deuenerim, “found my way by chance: cp. Cic. Att. i.
9. 13 and Brut. 157: consideranti ad quos ista non translata
sint sed deuenerz'nt.

98. date operam ε see on 67.

100. acre: see critical note, in which 1 have shown that

Pseud. i. 9. 39 ; and acre for acriter is found in Persius, iv. 34 ;
and in acre inuadunt Sall. Frag This usage is very common
