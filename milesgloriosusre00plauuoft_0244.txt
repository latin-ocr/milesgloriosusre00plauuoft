154 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

163. mulcassitis = mulcauerz'tz's. This form is common in
Plautus. For male, see on 128. ,Male with a verb intensifies ;
with an adjective often negares, as male sobrius = ebrius.

164. atque . . . aleariae, “Aye, more-don’t let there be
an ankle-bone among· them at supper: then they can't elude the
Gambling Act.'' The Roman dice were tali, ἀστράγαλοι,
“ankle-bones.'’ They bore numbers on four sides, the two
ends being left blank; the numbers were Ι, 3, 4, 6; the lowest
throw was four aces ; the highest was either when the four sixes
turned up, or (according to a different way of playing the game)
when the numbers were all different. The Latin names were
unz'0‚ ternio, quaternio, senio. The best throw was called
Venus, basilicus (because the king of the feast was appointed
by it); the worst throw was uolturiz', canes .· see iacit uolturios
quatuor Cur. ii. 3. 78 ς me quoque per talos Venerem quaerente
secundam 1 semper damnosi subsiluere canes Prop. iv. 8, 45.
’ Fraudem, which in later Latin means “ treachery‚” in Plautus
means harm, a colloquial usage which we also find in Cic.
Att. vii. 26. 2: id milti fraudem tulz't,· elsewhere only in the
phrase s. f. (= sine fraude) esto in laws, and fraudi esse. The
phrase facio fraudem is also found = “I elude,'’ as here, in
Cic. Att. iv. 12: facio fraudem Scto.

167. ita . . . iussit, “ so strict were his orders t0.’‘·

168. illis ceteris; probably dative, as quid tu mz'lzz' facies
Cas. 1. 29; but often ablative is thus used, e. g. 973; so with
suat 299 ; we have quid mihi futurumst Men. iv. 2. 1003 and

quid me futurumst Truc. ii. 4. 63. For z'llz‘s ceteris, see on
122.

169. estne = nonne est ‚· the particle nonne is post-Plautine.
Satin also is often used for nonne.

172. tumultuas = tumultuaris. Such a treatment of de-
ponent verbs is a very characteristic feature of early Latin.
Hence, in Cic. Att. iv. 16. 6, sortita = sorte ducta is quite
right if the word be regarded as forming a part of the Setum,
and therefore belonging to archaic language. A very long list
of such verbs might be constructed from the early dramatists.
The following are found in Plautus alone :—adgredio‚ adsen-
tio, amplecto, amplexo, arbitro, aucupo, auspico (exauspico),
comminisco, congraeco, contemplo, crimino, cunct0‚fabrico (per-
fabrico), fabulo, fluctuo, frustro, horto, indipisco, insecto‚ inter·
mino, lucto (delucto), ludifico, lucro, mereo, moro, minito,
