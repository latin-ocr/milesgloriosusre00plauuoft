PREFA OE ΤΟ ΤΗΕ THIRD EDITION.

with the plebs in favour of Scipio’s assuming command against
Hannibal, and reflects very brightly and completely those fea-
tures of the Second Punic War which were prominent and
recent in 205 B.C. No other period in the war matches the
passage with any completeness. The passage is one which
might naturally be expected because of Plautus’ plebeian sym-
pathies⁷ his desire in an early play to win favor with his
audiences, and because of the fact that his dramas are loosely
wrought, and are free enough to admit of just such license.
They were more like comic operas than formal comedies. The
correspondence of this passage in important details with the
date of the play otherwise ascertained is an additional con-
sideration in favor os such date, and makes it reasonably cer-
tain, as between 206 B.C. and 205 B.C., that 205 B.C. is the true
date 'of the Miles. Ι think it quite a reasonable conjecture to
say that, taking Naevius’ offence as committed in September
or November, 206, the expiration of the term of office of the
Metelli in February, 205, the plea of Scipio before the Senate
in February, 205, the lllz'les on the stage while Naevius was in
prison and Scipio was asking to be sent against Hannibal—that,
under these circumstances, the most likely time for Naevius'
release was not till aster, but probably soon aster, M. Metellus
went out of praetorian office, in February, 205 B.C.
