INTR OD U ΟΤΙ ON. xxxiii

Hence it has been questioned whether it was one of
the actors who said plaudite, or a person introduced
sor this special purpose, and called cantor. It may
be that Horace by the name cantor designates the
tibicen referred to above. Most probably Ω really
only indicates the actor who left the stage last.

BCD of course present the errors common to all
mss, namely, dittography, as uim me cogis for ui me
cog-2& 454; aulem milia for aulem z'lla,· see also 5953
lipography, as mortem ale for mortem male 1 63 ; sz' uiue-
rent for sz'uz' uiuerent 5 0 ; sz'mz'le sciat f or sz' m iles scial 3 09 ε
ablepsy, as ludificandi for ludz'fizcz'undz' 991 ; palatur
for sputator 647.

But they labour under a proneness to other errors :
some peculias to cursive mss may be pointed out herc.

(1). They confuse cl and d.- see on 1.

(z). ,‚ c and l: see on 100, 620.

(3). ‚, in and m: see on 648.

(4). ‚, u and b.- see on 853.

(5). All these mss, but especially Ba (see p. xlii),

tal stroke over a vowel, which stood for m .· see 658,
where B preserves the right reading, conlra cum, while
CD, combining errors (z) and (6), give contramlum‚
whence arose the reading contra emplum in FZ, and
contra empsim, the conjecture of Lipsius. See also
cr. note on 738, 784.

(7). They often give the wrong person osa tense:
see 923, 926.

(8). Also αί and ad, habeo (habes ἃς.) and abeo,
moechum and mecum, are often confounded.

Good illustrations of the worthlessness of FZ may
be found in these places :—

(a). 343. For clam se, CD by error (1) gives dam se.
Hence eadem (a very bad conjeclure) F Z.
