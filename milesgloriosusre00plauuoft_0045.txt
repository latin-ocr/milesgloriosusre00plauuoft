1 will take each of these in order.

(A).—L0NG Vowan SHORTENED.

We find in ancient Latin Comedy vowels long
both by (a) nature and (β) by position scanned as
short, as (a) nou& lz'berlo : (β) paler uenit.

Now to meet this difficulty four courses have been
taken. (a) It has been attempted to emend all the
verses in which these irregularities occur; (b) a
sort of slurring pronunciation has been supposed
whereby nouo, pater were pronounced as one syllable ;
(c) it has been held that the law of position was
neglected by the early poets; (d) it has been ac-
counted for by the influence of accent on early Latin
metre.

The first (a) is obviously most unscientific. After
we have emended hundred of places, hundreds more
will remain to defy emendation. Yet this very un-
scientific method has been largely followed by the
earlier edd. of Plautus. Wherever the remedy was
easy, they made the verse conform to Augustan
prosody‚ but where it was difficult they left the ano—
maly untouched‚ and attributed it to the licentious
and barbarous versification of the early poets; for
instance, in z'tcz h‘z‘c senex Mil. 167, Pylades restores
the metre, as he thinks, by omitting hic, yet he leaves
untouched scores of places in the Miles, where the
same apparent anomaly exists, but where no obvious
remedy presents itself. The second course (b) has
found a champion in the late Prof. Key. He holds
that soror was pronounced soor, and paler peter, and
appeals to the Romance languages where soror and
pater appear as meur, pire. But this theory would be
applicable to only a verv limited number of words if
