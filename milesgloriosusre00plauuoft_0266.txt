2. 30. Propertius often uses 111ίεὶτοὶ a rival, referring, of course
to himself as the first.

289. Sceledre scelus. A paronomasia· see 330, 494. So
faciet Crucisalum me ex Chrysalo Bacch. ii. 3. 1283 Lyde, ludo
i. 2. 21; non Clzarznus mi hic quidem sed Copia, with a play on
carere, Pseud ii. 4. 46; while 1n the same scene (verse 22) there
is a play on Charinus andx χάριν. Also damnum in Epidamno
Men. ii. 1. 42; Phoeniczum phoenicio corto Pseud. i. 2. 97· ,
Sosiam . . . socium Amph. 1. 1. 227 ; and so Lucrio . . . excru-
cz'abere 842, below, if the old reading Lucrio be retained ; but see
note on that verse.

290. profecto: see on 186.

tutine- - tutene, · short e final, when in comp. with a conso-
nant, becomes z, as undique, indidem, z'stici,ne quippissnz anti-d

, hac, antidit, antistare; so ΒΧ writesfaci'lzn for facilene, ser-

uzrz'n for seruerene usqum for usquene.

291. abi, here a word of dissent or reproach: so 324 = “get
ouL”: very often, however, it has quite the opposite meaning,
laudo patrissas, abi“ that will do: you are a chip of the old
block’' Ter. Ad. 564. In both cases abi means “you may go
now,” “you have satisfied me’ ’(whether the conclusion
arrived at be for or against the person addressed).1nthe same
way, sczn quomodo, scin quam generally means (1)“ you have

good heart. You’ ve no idea what a good heart Ι ’ll keep'';
but (2) sometimes also the phrase is merely a threat, “I' ll teli
you what,” as in Rud. 111. 5. 18; Aul. i. 1. 8- Ιος and scm

quam potest, “It can be put off. Can it? I’ll let you know
whether it can or not,⁷’ Pers. i. 3. 59. From this passage, as
well as Bacch. iv. 2. 12, it may be seen that this phrase may be
followed either by indicative or subjunctive.

293. tollas, “ Lord love you, don't be in a hurry tofather
that report.’³ Literally, “ if the gods were well disposed to you,
you would not rashly ’' &c. Tollere is best explained by quod
erit natum tollito Amph. 1. 3. 3. Sc. is advised not to take on
himself the responsibility of the report. ΒΧ holds that tollere:
