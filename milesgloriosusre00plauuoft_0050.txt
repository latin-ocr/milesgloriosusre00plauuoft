Hiatus has always been, and probably will long be?
the chief subject of difference among Plautine
scholars. To obviate hiatus, Ritschl‚ in his ed.
of 1848, resorted very largely to conjecture; and
afterwards, in his Neue Plantz'nz'sche Excurse (1869),
he rashly introduced an ablativa] d, not only into
nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, but also into ad-
verbs, prepositions, and imperatives. By means of
this device, together with the hypothesis of a nom.

⁴ plur. of 1st decl. in -as, and the introduction of

forms like cubi, eunde, for ubi, unde, Ritschl almost
drove hz'cztus out of the plays of Plautus. But soberer
counsels now prevail, and in the following cases
hiatus 1s admitted by all judicious edd. :—

x ). At a change of speaKers.

(z). In the ccesum of the verse.

(3). In the dz'ceresz's of the verse3 that is, in those
verses which fall naturally into two parts, as octona-
rian and septenarian iambics and trochaicS‚ and
cretic tetrameters.

To these may be added (though by no means
generally admitted)—

(4). Hiatus (Fleckeisen's) after monosyllables end—⁷
ing in a long vowel or m, the long vowel which
suffers lzz’afus being shortened‚ as

qui sis tarn pulcer. uel illae quae heri pallio.
id dnm ero amanti seruos nuntiare uolt.

(5). Hiatus (Spengel’s) after dissyllables in a re-

solved arsis, the long vowel being shortened‚ as her-‘2‘
