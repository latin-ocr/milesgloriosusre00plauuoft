1383. cumulate commoditate. Commoditas has generally
been wrongly explained, as isit meant “ advantage, benefit,'' or
again, “complaisance, agreeableness.'’ The word is used in
these senses in the plural by Ter. (Phorm. 841 ; Andr. 569); but
in Plautus it is only used in sing, and always means ‘⁴ conve·
nience, opportuneness‚'’ as above, 1134. Here commoditas is
used in reference to the “ opportune appearance '' of the
lllz‘les. In Men. i. 2. 31 Men. says non potuisti magis per
tempus mz' aduenire quam aduenis, to which Pe. replies‚ ita ego
soleo: commoditatis (z εὐκαιρίας) omnis articulos scz'0; such,
also, is the usage of commoditatem in Poen. iv. 2. 94. In
Men. i. 2. 28 o mea commoditas, 0 mea opportunitas salue, we
have a good instance of the proper meaning of this word in Pl.
Again, Milphidiscus is addressed as mea commoditas in Poen. i.
3. 13 ; and Epidicus in Epid. v. 1. 8. Here cumulate comm. is
an intentionally grotesque and inflated expression, “richly
blessed with opportuneness.’'
