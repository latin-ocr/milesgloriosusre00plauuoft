B.—-SH0RT VowEL LENGTHENED.

We now come to the second heading, (B)—short
vowels found long in Pl. The influence of Accent
is not in this case operative, and we shall simply
have to give a list of archaic long vowels.

(1). a is long in nom. and voc. sing. of 1st decl.,
chiefly in proper names, as Sosia, Leonida, but
possibly also in common nouns. Fleckeisen de—
fends the mss where they give epistula, libera, ineptia,
tesi-eren but Rstschl, Miiller‚ and Ussing correct these
passages.

(2). es, gen. ilis, is sometimes long, as mileu and
es from sum is always long, but ades 1030.

(3). or is long in substantives‚ as amam compara-
tives‚ as audiam verbs, as fale0r; and even particleS‚
as ecastor.

(4). ἒί is long in 5th decl.⁹ as fidei Aul. 575.

(5). e in abl. of 3rd. is sometimes long, e.g. uxor&
Mil. 6993 morl& 707.

(6). -szs in dat. and abl. plur. is defended by
some editors.

(7). In adverbs and conjunctions modo is com-
mon; imm& is always long; zgz'z‘zzr is defended by
some edd.

(8). In verbs, -e of the infin. is sometimes long, as
ptvmerc? Mil. 848; dicere 1346; -ᾶί, -el, -zt, and -is in
pres. perf. and fut. ind. and subj. So -ᾶν, -ὀν (and,
according to some, -ῐιν). Es from sum, as we have
seen, is always long in Pl.; and in fieri (fierem), ὣς.
the first syll. is long.
