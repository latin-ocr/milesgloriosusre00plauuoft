ln one respect the Asilas closely resembles the
Cistellaria .- as in the lllz'les the introductory scene,
in which the gasconading Pyrgopolinices figures
so amusingly, is followed by an explanation of
the plot quite in the style and fashion of a pro-
logue; so in the Cistellaria the play opens with an
admirable scene, in which the characters of Silenium
and Gymnasium disclose themselves in a conversa-
tion with the Lena ; and it is only in the third scene
(the Lena having in the second told the story of
Silenium) that the goddess Auxilium speaks the pro·
logue. This feature would no doubt be found in the
Greek exemplam indeed this treatment of the pro-
logue was originated (as has been observed) by
¹ Euripides in his Iphzgrenm z'n Aulis& The prologues
prefixed to the Plautine plays are no doubt, as a rule,
spurious. This is proved by the style, which exagge-
rates the ruggedness of Plautino diction and metre,
and by frequent references to Plautus in a manner
which seems to imply that he is no longerliving (see,

ἕ The prologues prefixed to the plays of Plautus are far more
Euripidean than those of Terence, who uses them as vehicles for
a defence of his own literary views, and to rebut the strictures
of adverse critics. In this respect the latter rather resemble
the parabasz's of Greek comedy. The former are subservient
to the explanation of the plot (as with Euripides), but are
often disfigured by cumbrous attempts at humour, and pon-
derous bantering of the audience. Most of the prologues
are post-Plautine3 and even the genuine ones are full of addi-
tions and interpohtions, as may be observed in the prologues of
the Mercator, T rinummus, and Truculentus. Plautus follows
Menander in often assigning his prologue to some god, as to the
Lar in Aulularia ,· to Arcturus in the Rudens,- to Luxuria in
the Trinummus ,· sometimes, also, to one of the personae, as in
the fllercatom or to an actor speaking in the name of the poet,
as in the Truculentus. The Terentian prologues are spoken by
an actor dressed for the purpose, and bearing an olive branch as
a suppliant for the favour and indulgence of the spectators.
