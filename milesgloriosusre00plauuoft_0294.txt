moditatibus in the Comic Drama.

681. oblatratricem, “ a scold.'' Latrare, “ to bark‚'' is used
in the sense of ‘⁴ to crave, demand vehemently’¹ in Lucr. ii. 17
nil aliud sibi naturam latrare nisi ut &c. In Cas. prol. 34
Latine (scripsit) Plautus cum latranti nomine, the joke (such as

Most ii. 1. 2. ; tr. “it is a pleasant thing.”
