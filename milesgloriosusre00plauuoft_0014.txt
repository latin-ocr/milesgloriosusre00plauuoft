PBEFA OE

overlooked the fact that Bothe long ago proposed
an im amittis for ani amittis and anima amittis of the
mss on Mil. Glor. 1424, where there seems to be
far more reason for the introduction of im than in
any of the passages where Birt would supply that
form. He would also read indu for in in le. Glor.
332 and 351 (where he denies the possibility of
making quoz’z'quam trisyll. with Brix), in 421, and in
many places (13 in all) in the other plays, where the
metre seems to demand the change.

In 368—
PH. Tu me vidisti? Sc. Atque his quidem hercle oculis.

PH. Carebis credo.

Birt would read corgo (explained by Paul. Fest.
as=profecto). But this semi-ironical use of words
like credo, opinor, “ I am thinking‚” is quite Plautine z
cp. Cas. 111. 6. ε), dabo tibi μέγα κακόν ut opinor.
He would introduce the same word, or in some
cases probe ego instead of projecto, wherever it occurs,
and often instead of hercle and other exclamations‚
when the metre would be improved by the change.

For 481—

Satin abiit ille neque erili negotio-

he proposes

Satin abiit ille? nec hercle suom negotium 3

and in 587, 588, he would read-

Occisarn saepe sapere plus stulto suem
Quoi mens adimatur ne id quod vidit viderit.
