N OTES. 209

fact is, that planum has two meanings—“ evident '² and “level,'‘
and ex procliue) is introduced merely to supply a play on planum,
without any thought of the comparative difficulty of going
downhill or travelling along a level plane: but in the passages
where it occurs by itself, the idea of the facility of downward
motion is clearly present to the mind of the writer. For enim,
see on 1289.

1019. uel adest uel non, “As you please, whatever you
wish,’' and as it is clear that the speaker desires the absence of

eavesdroppers, the phrase is equivalent to a statement that there
is no sear of a surprise. See on 25.

1020. tribus uerbis. Tribus is used where we should say
“a couple’' Cic. Fam. ix. 19. 1. Longz'nquo = longo, “pro-
tracted‚’' as in Cic. Caes. Liv. ; so longinquom loqui Merc. iii.
4. 2 5. Iam ad te redeo is addressed to the Miles.

1028. aciem, “sharpness.''

1029. uenator, “take your cue from me '' (lit. “ pursue the

qui esset, “worthier to be a g0d‚” a curious hyperbaton, is
indeed the reading is right.

ergo, “then he is not human at all—(aside) a vulture has as
much humanity as he.” Volturius is generally a type of rapa-
city; Cic. calls Verres uoltum‘usprouz·ncz‘ae‚· so also in Trin. i.
2. 64; here it is merely an expression of detestation.

h {OQ-b mag-num me faciam, used in same sense as carum te
a es a ove.

1047. quanam ab. Anastrophe of the prep. is very frequent
in Pl. occursant : see note 011 482.

1054. Achiles. The mss give Achilles, which ΒΧ retains,
scanning fiat as one syllable. It is, however, very probable
that here and at 1289 Plautus followed the alternative Greek

sordm Ἀχιλεύς. In 57 either form may stand: see note ou
12 9.

1058. pollicitares: see on 172.
