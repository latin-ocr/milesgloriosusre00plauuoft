NOTES. 153

up to the time of Nero is only found with the Ist person, was
misled by an erroneous theory that equidem etymologically =
ego quidem. But, equidem ego and ego equidem are osten found
together, and Priscian was certainly right in denying this etymo-
logy, and in holding that equidem can be used with 2nd and 3rd
person (and even plural number, as in Verg. Aen. x. 29). The
following are the places where equidem is found against Bent-
Iey’s rule in poetry (sor in prose the change to quidem is always
possible) z—Verg. Aen. x. 29; Prop. ii. 31. 53 Pers. v. 45;
Luc. viii. 824; and in Plautus (omitting many passages where
the mss give equidem, but the metre allows quidem) we have the
following, where the metre rejects quidem :——Aul. ii. 1. 19;
Epid. iv. 2. 26; Men. iii. 3. 27; Pers. iv. 4. 843 with atque
the mss always give equidem, whatever the number or person.
The fact is, that equidem is a strengthened form of quidem, as
ehem of hem, elzeu of heu, enim of nam.

arbitri, “ witnesses'’: cp. locus effusi late maris arbiter

nunc adeo. Adeo here strengtlzens the nunc, “ now, what⁷s
more'’; so atque adeo 1643 and neque adeo Capt. ii. 2. 98. In
later Latin adeo has merely a corrective force, as in ego princeps
atque adeo secundus Cic. Att. 1. 17. 9 ; quod ad te antea atque
adeo prius seri-fisi Att. xv. 13. 3, where the words mean ‘⁶ or
rather,” not ‘⁶ and what's more.’'

162. quod. ille dicat: cp. quod quispiam ignem quaerta
Aul. i. 2. 13; and As. iv, 1. 12—513 the difference between
quod with subjunctive and quod with indicative may be perceived

by comparing these passages with Mil. 504, 506, 508, 510, 1114.
