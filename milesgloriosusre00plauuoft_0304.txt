202 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

852. loculi, “spot‚” dimin. of locus. ΡΙ. has some strange
dimin„ e. g. recula dim. of res (Frag.); spicula “a gleam os
hope ⁷’ Cas. 3 uxorcula Cas„ ralla (= rarula) Epid.

853. aula = olla. sic, δεικτικῶς.
8 55. conplebatur = complebat se.

856. ubi . . . cadi. The Roman cadi and amphorae were
long, slender vessels, ending in a point. They were usually
buried in the ground to one—half or two-thirds of their length,
or put up against the wall of the cellar in an oblique position, to
prevent them from falling (Guhl and Koner, p. 458). The
latter position is probably the one referred to here, sor thus only
can the joke (such as it is) be explained. The slave pretends
that there was one slippery spot, owing to which the cadi some-
times slipped from their position, and emptied their contents
into the piteher, aula, which stood hard by; hence, when the
aula began its revels the cadi tottered, whereas usually the
drinking and staggering are done by the same person.

857. iam, “by this time, it has come to this that’': iam in
the next verse and 863 means “ presently.⁷'

862. This verse, like 1131, is addressed to the speetators:
huic refers to Pal. For the unnatural position of huic, cp. z'llz'c
hoc lzomo denuo uolt pallium detexere Amph. i. Ι. 138 ς there is
a similar hyperbaton in Amph. ii. 2. 163 As. i. 16.

865. infortunium, “the punishment'’; Lurcio makes over
his share of it to Pal.

873. succedit sub manus, “ comes to hand” (lends itself to
my manipulation)‚ a metaphor probably taken from pottery.

ACT III.—SCENE III.

875. ordine, “ from beginning to end.''

881. meretricem . . . clamet, “ every one knows how much
good there is in reminding a woman like me.’' An ironical
remark. Literally‚ “ it is no secret (ironically) how much good
there is in reminding one like me.’' But nil clamst is a very
doubtful expression, and probably we should read me or mz'
clamst. In Pl. clam is followed by dat. aecus. and abl.
