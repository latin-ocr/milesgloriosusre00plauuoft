aquam Cur. ii. 3. 33. The more dignified word for “to swoon’'
is linqui animo or linqui: cp. Linquor et ancillis excipienda
cado Ov. H. ii. 130. So animus reliquerat 1347.

1334. habent: sc. Pleusicles and Philocomasium3 the lovers

are supposed to forget themselves, and embraee even in the
presence of the llliles.

1335. labra ab labellis. Labra are the man’s lips, labella
the woman'S, according to ΒΧ, who quotes Pseud. v. 1. 14,
labra ad labella adz'ungit‚· however, we have labra a labris
nusquam auferat Bacc. iii. 3. 76.

1345. resipisti, for reszjszuistz', which is the old form of resi·
puistz',· so z'mposz'ui = imposui.

1346. apud me, “in my senses’' cp. Gk. ἐν ἑαυτῷ εῖναι
Ar. Vesp. 6425 this phrase is common in Ter.

Ι 349. nos secundum, “ carried aster (behind) us through
the city.’' Secundum is not elsewhere found as a prep. in this
sense, except in a fragment of Pl. quoted by Priscian, secundum
ij>sam aram aurum abscondz'dz'; it is often used as “behind’'
adverbially. For the anastrophe, see 1047.

1355. gratiam rerum omnium. Gratiam is generally fol-
lowed by pro, ob, quod, quom, quonz'am‚· it takes accus. with
infin. only in ante-classical Latin. Ι do not know of any other
case in which it is followed by the gen. when it means ‘⁶ thank-
fulness, gratitude.'’ Gratia, followed by the gen„ means
“exeuse, release, pardon, forgiveness ⁷’; and this sense would
suit the present passage, but that gratiam facia would be
required instead ofgr. habeo. Pl. has a predilection for con·
structions with the gen. ; we find a gen. aster credere, As. ii. 4.
53; so also after mendax and falsus. Gratias is always used
with agere‚· but with habere, referre, debere always gratiam,
except when thanks are given by more than one person, or to
more than one person, e. g. As. iii. 2. 1, perfidiae laudes gra·
tiasqzce habemus merito magnas 1 quom, where he expressly adds
that he speaks for himself and his conlega,· Trin. iv. Ι. 1, Nep-
tuno 1 gratis gratiasque habeo et fluctibus salsis. Poen. i. 1. 6,
fateor deberi tibi Ι et libertatem et multas gratis gratias, cannot
be taken as an exception to the rule, because the expression is
designedly hyperbolical and comic. The passage in the text is
nearly paralleled by nec tu eam habebis gratiam Most. iii. 3. 2 3,
where eam gratiam = eius rei gratiam, just as eam copiam =
