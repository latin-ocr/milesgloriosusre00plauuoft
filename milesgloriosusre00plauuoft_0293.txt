656. plus . . . tibi. Thisis in answer to 654 siquas memo-
rat uirtutis habet. Per. says “ 1 shall show myself not only as

657. ueges. This is a transitive form of uigere found in old
Lat. = “to cause to be‚” it should be recognised in Lucr.

ciples in consormity with (you make them conform to) charm
os manner” ε cp. aequora salsa neges z'ngentz'bu' uentis Enn. ap.

658. aurichalco contra, “I would give their weight in
gold sor.” This word is a corruption of ὀρείχαλκος “ mountain
copper‚” and the corruption was caused by a salse etymology
from aurum. It is often found in Pl. in this phrase, is used
in quite the same sense as αανο, and is introduced merely for
the sake of varying the expression. cum: see on 16.
