618. istuc aetatis = tam grandaeuo ‚· it is used as if it were
an adj. qualifying lzomz'm'; so hoc, z'd, illuc aetatis, hoc noctis, z'd
temporzlm istuc διε. are accusatives.

619. te decora. Decere in Pl. takes not only accus. but abl.
and dat. ; decora is here followed by abl. ; so dzgnus in Pl. and
Ter. takes accus. as well as abl. Capt. v. 2. 16; As. i. 2. 23;
Ter. Phorm. 519.

620. summis opibus, “ with all your might.'’ The classical
expression is summa ope, omni ope, which Pl. does not use.
Opem, ope in Pl. have no meaning but that of “ aid, help ''; for
of course ope nostra censerier (Cas. prol. 15) is not Plautine.
We have ex summis opibus uiribusque Merc. i. 2. 1; opibus
omni copia As. i. 3. 923 summis opibus atque industriis Most. ii.
1. 1; omnibus opibus Stich. i. 1. 44. Cic. Tusc. iii. 25 has
omnibus uiribus atque opibus. Obicere, expetere, ire, facere all
depend on crucz'at,· the asyndeton is to be noticed. For expe-
tere see on 1386.

mei honoris. The same hiatus is found in qui simulauit
mei honoris mittere lzuc causa coquos Aul. iii. 4. 4, in mihi
amanti 621, and very frequently in Pl. Mei honoris gratia is
“through regard sor me”; honor is “regard, respect’'; in
Capt. ii. 3. 32 lzonor (according to my view of the passage) is
personified‚ Honore honestiorem affording an example of a Pl.
usage well illustrated in As. ii. 2. 2, lubentz'oresfacz'am quam
Lubentz'ast, “ more joyous than Joy herself.''

(522. quae . . . solet, “Things which a man of your age
usually leaves off if praetised before, instead of involving himself
voluntarily in them, as you are doing.’'

625. nihil amas, “you are no lover’': cp. quid ames, quid
simules “ how far you are in love '’ Pseud. i. 1. 71. Thls might
also have been expressed by nullus amas, a common idiom in
PL, and found also in Cic. Epp. frequently.

um'nra’s, “only the pale reflection of a lover.⁷' Vmbra is
used in a strange sense in Pers. ii. 4. 27, where Paegnium says
umbra mea intus uapulat, i. e. “ I am on the point of a beating '⁹
(so near that my shadow feels it even now).

627. Acherunticus, “such an old Death’s head.” The first
syll. of Acheron is long in Pl. : cp. φαιῡχίτων in Aesch.
