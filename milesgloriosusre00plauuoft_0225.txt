N OTES. 139

sels the son of Neptune.” But perhaps the allusion is rather a
general one: cp. “praestantissimos uirtute Iouis filios poetae
appellauerunt, ferocissimos et immanes et alienos ab omni hu-
manitate tamquam a mari genitos Neptuni filios dixerunt’'
Gen. xv. 21 ; so also, “ Quid de sacrilegis, quid de impiis periur-
isque dicemus

Tubulus si Lucius umquam,
Si Lupus aut Carbo [aut] Neptuni filius

ut ait Lucilius, putasset esse Deos, tam periurus aut tam im·
purus fuisset?” Cic. Nat. Deor. 1. 63.

16. cum in Plautus osten couples the attributes or properties
with the subject where, later Latin would use an adjective or

participle: see 658, and Poen. iv. 2. 30 haud amice sacis qui
cum onere (= onusto) offers moram.

18. paniculum tect. properly “ reed-down‚’' here probably
used sor the reeds themselves which were employed for thatch-
ing; see quin tu z'n paludem is, exsiccasque arundinem, lqui
pertegamus uillam dum sudumst Rud. i. 2. 34. paniculus is
always feminine, panicula, except here. The following nouns
neuter in later Latin are masculine in Plautus :—c0llus‚ corius
(sometimes corium), dorsus, guttur, lac (lactes = intestines, but
lacte is always the nominative form and is probably neuter),
papaver, sinus (a bowl): on the other hand we find nasum
for nasus, pane for panis, and artua from artus ,· again prae·
sepe is praesepis (sem.) in Cur. ii. Ι. Ι3ς in Mil. 140 the mss
give conclauem, perhaps rightly; and sinapis is feminine in
Pseud. iii. 2. 28. Nonius says that Plautus uses tergum mascu-
line, misunderstanding habeo familiarem tergum As. ii. 2. 53:
frons “a sorehead'' is masculine 202, and is quoted as having
been used as masculine in the Origines· of Cato, the Subditz'uos

of {feeihus' and other old writers. Lux is generally masculine
m antus.

20, prae ut . . . feceris, “in comparison with other feats
that I could tell os—your not having done.” From tu quae
numquam to bene, 24, the words of Art. are aside.

21. periuriorem periurus is simply “a liar” in Plautus, not
“a perjurer,'' which is rather expressed by mendax. In this
sense mendax is followed by gen. of object, si huius rei me esse
mendacem inueneris As. v. 2. 5 ; credere has the same construc-
tion As. ii. 4. 53, quoi omnium rerum ipsus semper credit.
