600 Dicat: ‘da mihi, uir, kalendis meam qui matrem
iuvenm:
Da qui farcit, da qui condit: da quod dem quinqua-
tribus

Praecantatrici‚ coniectrici‚ ariolae atque aruspicae:
Flagitiumst, si nil mittetur: quo supercilio spicit.

690. iuverim Bx; ueneritc D ; uenerit (with iuuerit super-
scribed) B. 691. da . . . condit Bothe; da quifaciat
condiat da M (except Ba, which gives the obviously corrupt saciat
conclamand0); R followed by most recent edd. gives da qui
faciam condimenta. A. Palmer has shown (Hermathena,
No. v. p. 263) that in Most i. 2. 37 faciunt should be replaced
by farciunt. The conjecture of R is as improbable as his transpo-
sition of v. 693 to after v. 697. 692. praecantatrici CDFZ;
praecatricz' B ; praecantrz'cz' R after Scaliger and Bentley, thus
leaving a hiatus, to avoid which Koch reads sam'olae (see v. 2).
B leaves out one syllable as in patricam for plicatricem in 6943
obstrex for obstetrix 696. 693. quo sup. spicit FZ. I
am loth to change this reading, which all editors give; but Ι
am convinced it is wrong. FZ are full of bad conjectures.
BCD with A give quae, which Festus also preserves (R says
“quae non quo mirum est etiam Festum testari''). Ι believe
there is an ellipse of ei before quae (as A. Palmer has suggested
to me), just as twice in 691 ; and that either (1) quae supercilio
spicit describes some woman who practised some obscure mode
of divination from eyebrows ; or (2) we should read quae super-
cilia auspicat, “who augurs from (the twitchings &c. of) eye-
brows’'; auspico is used with accus. Stich, iii. 2. 46 in this
sense, where auspican: mustellam means ‘⁴ to draw an omen from
a weasel’'; and we find in Pseud. i. 1. 105 that the twitching of
the eyebrow was a sign that a hope would be fulfilled, quia
futurumst ita supercilium salzt. The same superstition is re-
