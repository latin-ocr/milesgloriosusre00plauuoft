628. capularis: cp. capuli decus As. v. 2. 42, and τύμβος
γέρων Eur. Med. 1209, which I believe means “old tomb, ” as

631. albicapillus. It was the custom on the Roman stage
that old men should appear in white wigs‚ young men in black,
slaves in red. These wigs (galearia) were often worn instead oi
masks (personae), and we may conjecture that personae were
not worn in this play, as this would be inconsistent with the
description of Pal. plunged in thought, above, 200 ff. Per. is
albicapillus, though only fifty-four years of age, and is always
spoken of as senex.

senet = senescit, found in Pacuvius 275, 3043 Attius 612;
Catullus' 1v. 26; and Persius vi. 6. In the last passage (Persius
vi. 6) Conington seems, Ι think, to have taken senes for a verb
in his translati0n; but Prof. N‘ettleship explains it as a subst.
in the commentary. Cp. anet‘ ‘'she 1s an old wornan’' Merc. iv.
4. 15, where an excellent verse is restored by the restoration of
this verb anere “ to be an old woman.'' The verse satis scitum
filum mulier-zl- ,· uirum hercle auct has been thoroughly emended
by reading sor the last three words uerum hercle anet, “ a good
figure of a woman3 but, i' saith, she's old.’' Ab ingenio = “ on
the score of, as regards, mind,” is common in Pl. and Cic. Epp.
e. g. a pecunia Aul. 11. 2. 9; innoxius ab aliquo ib. 44; ab
anima perire Truc. i. 1. 28; copioso a frumento Cic. Att. v.
18. 2. Anere is not in Lewis and Short.

632. sua sibi. Sibi is to be taken closely with sua as part of
an expression = ‘⁶ his own ”z cp. suo sibi = suo ipse Capt. prol.
5 ; and suo sz'bz' gladio lzunc iugulo Ter. Ad. 958.

amussitata: cp. examussim disputem Men. prol. 50: exa-

634. oppido, ob pedam “along the level plain’'; hence =
plane· m origin and sense- - “plainly, clearly, without doubt.'’

635. periclum facies, “make tn'al of me.''

636. nota noscere. cp. actum agere Ter. Ph. 419; znuen-
