144 MILES GL ORIOS VS.

surdaster, Fuluiaster, Antoniaster ; and we are familiar with it
in our own word poetaster; and in French opz‘nz'citre = “ obsti-
nate ”; verddtre, ‘⁴ greenish ’'; blanchcitre. “ whitish.”

siui uiuerent. For the ellipse of ut see above on 1 1, Arg. Ι.
The critical note on this verse should be carefully read; it well
exemplifies the value of, the Ambrosian palimpsest in the criti·
cism of Plautus.

52. unum. Vnus is often used to strengthen the superlative
in Plautus, as in unam . . . optumam, unam . . . audacissumam
&a ; but also with positive, as in unum pollens atque honora-
tz'ssumum Capt. ii. 2. 283 solus is used with positive in same
sense osten in Terence.

55. uel. See on 25.

57. hicine, “is not this Achilles ’‘? ne = nonne, which is

’ not found in old Latin.

58. eius frater. Achilles had no brother3 the relation-
ships of the Olympian deities are cornically misrepresented:
e. g. Juno is called Iouis filia in Cist. ii. 1. 45 ff.

ibi, “thereupon '': cp. Trin. ii. 1. 19, 21, z'bz' ille cuculus, and
ibi pendentem ferit.

9. ergo, ‘⁶ that is why he is so handsome'⁷ (because he is
the brother of Achilles); ergo osten thus refers (see 380) t⁰.³
preceding statement, sometimes also to a followmg clause, as ¹.¹²
ergo quia sum tangere ausus Aul. iv. 10. 25. In Pl. ergo is -
osten merely continuative, = ‘⁴ well.’' Ergo never = ἔργῳ.

62. quae me obsecrauerint. “ Is it after their imploring
me?'’ i. e. “ (do you ask such a question about women)' who
have implored me ?’ ’ &c. This is a common ellipse in Plautus ε
see below, 406, 973, 985; ne is also sometimes added, as in
quodne amem (= id non osculer quod amem) Merc. iii. 3. 12.
Very similar to this usage is the Hibernicism sure, ‘⁴ sure they
both asked me.”

67. dare operam has two meanings in Plautus—( 1) “ to be
at one’s service, to give one's services'' (the proper meaning os
the phrase); (2) “to give one's attention, to listen.” In 774
we have tszz' damus operam auribus. The phrase has the first
meaning in Cic. Epp. (Fam. vii. 24· 2 : Att. xiii. 49. 1).
