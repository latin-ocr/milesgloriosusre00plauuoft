feature, too, in a Plautinesabula presents a strong
contrast to the modern comedy. All the play, ex-
cept scenes written in iambic senarii, was sung to
the accompaniment of a tibia, for it seems certain
that all the scenes except those written in iambic
senarii were cantica, and the senarii alone were di-
verbz'afl‘ It will be seen, therefore, that a very small
portion of the Meles was spoken like a modern
comedy3 by far the larger part was sung, short
scenes being occasionally spoken, as in the modern
opera bouffe.

In many respects the lllz‘les Gloriosus is the most
interesting of the plays of Plautus. We meet, in the
broad burlesque of the first scene of the play and
the second scene of Act ΙΙΙ, excellent specimens
of the characteristic vis comica of Plautus; and we
have, in the elaborate moralising of Periplecomenus,
600 ff., a scene which might well have been written
by Terence in his happiest vein. It was not the
favourite play of Plautus himself, or even one of his
favourite plays. Cicero (De Sen. 50) says that he
delighted most in the works of his old age: quam
(gaudebat) Truculento Flendus, quam Pseudulo! And
we find, in a curious passage in the Bacchides, where
the playwright steps out of his way to inveigh
against some incompetent actor, that the favourite
drama of Plautus was the Epidicus †—another instance
to show that authors are not the best judges of the
comparative merits of their own works. The Miles
Gloriosus is interesting as affording the. only in-
stance of a personal allusion to be found in the
plays of Plautus. This is the reference to the

† Non res sed actor mihi cor odio sauciat.
Etiam Epidicum, quam egofabulam aeque ac me ipsum amo,
Nullam aeque inuitus specto, si agit Pellio—ii. 2. 36 ff.
