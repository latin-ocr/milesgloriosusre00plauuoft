JVIJZQZS. 215

ing sz‘ non quibo . . . impetrare, just as ergo 1s explained by
quod . . . est in 1233, and lzoc in 1246 by tam . . . amarent

1247.
1245. sis = sz' uis, “ pray do not do it.”

1253. mutuom fit, “it is reciprocated by me.’' So mutua
fiunt in Pers. v. 1. 14; and mutuom mecum facit Trin. ii. 4. 37;
but in Cur. i. 1. 47 Phaedromus refines on the phrase in the
passage ea me deperit Ι ego autem cum illa facere nolo mutuom Ι
Pal. Quid z'ta ? Ph. Quia proprium facio. This passage is usually
wrongly explained, as if mutuom facere meant “ to borrow'’; but
it means “ to return.'' The real meaning may be thus con-
veyed-—“ She loves me to distraction3 and I return—no, I don‘t
return her love.'' ‘⁴ PAL. How do you mean ?'' “ PH. Because
1 won't part with any of it; 1 mean to keep it all myself.”
“ To borrow” is mutuom sumere, as in sz‘ pudoris egeas sumas
mutuom Amph. ii. 2. 187: cp. “affect a virtue if you have it
not ” (though of course this sentiment would require careas, not

egeas). The phrases sumere mutuom and facere mutuom are
sharply differentiated.

1256. nasum: see on 18.

ariolatur = dz'uz‘nat,· so always in Plautus. Arz'olari never
= nugas agere in Plautus, though that meaning emerges in
Terence (Phorm. 491; Ad. 202). Cic. uses the word in the
Terentian sense, non hariolans ut illa cui nemo credidit Att. viii.

11. 3. Ennius and Pomponius adhere to the Plautine use. The
word is probably connected with hirae “ entrails,'⁷ Gk. χορ -δή,

χολ -οίδες .· cp. aruspex. The only other places where the word
occurs in Pl. are, As. ii. 2. 50; iii. 2. 33; v. 2. 74; Cist. iv. 2.

80 ; Rud. ii. 3. 17, 46 ; iv. 4. 96. A reference to these passages
will show that Pl. never uses ariolari in the sense of nugas

agere. The etymology makes sor the orthography lzar-.
1257. fec-it eam ut: see on 341.

12 58. nescio ubi hic, “ somewhere hereabout.”

olet: sc. is quem expeto. Olere is generally personally in PL,
and means “to reveal onesclf by the smell.''

1261. per oculos, “ by reason of my eyes ”z see 1271.
1262. ita, “yes,’' usually itast.

1270. potis: sc. erit.
