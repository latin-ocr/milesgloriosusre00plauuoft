INTRODUCTION.

Ι.

THE Miles Gloriosus is, as we learn from verse 86 of
the play, founded on the Ἀλαζών of some Greek poet
now unknown to us. But it seems highly probable
that Plautus in this play resorted to contaminatio.
anci introduced into the first scene some portion of a
different Greek original, which may have been the
Κόλαξ of Menander, or (as Ritschl suggests) the
Αἱρησιτείχης of Diphilus. The latter hypothesis
perhaps derives some weight from the fact that in
¹055 the Jilz'les is addressed as Vrbz‘cape‚ which (as
well as the name of the Illz'les, Pyrgopolinices) would
be a literal rendering of the Greek αἱρησιτείχης.
Moreover, Plautus affects Diphilus rather than Me-
nander, whom he rarely selects for his model. The
Bacchides probably was taken from the Δὶς Ἐξαπατῶν
of Menander; the Poenulus from the Καρχηδόνιος;
and the Stichus from the Φιλάδελφοι; but apparently
no other os the extant plays owes its origin to Me-
nander. In any case, we may assume that the intro·
ductory scene is due to contaminatio, for we can hardly
otherwise account for the fact that Artotrogus so
completely vanishes from the scene* after he has
fulfilled his function of eliciting an illustration of
the vanity and stupidity of the Braggart Captain,
the Capitan Fracassa of modern Italy.

l· ἕ Pla8utus did not, however, altogether sorget him: see
me 94 .
