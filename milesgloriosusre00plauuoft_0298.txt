“ you are boring me to death”: cp. tundendo atque odio “ by
dinning and bon'ng '’ Ter. Hec. i. 2. 48 3 iam hic me abegerit suo
odio As. ii. 4. 40; iam lzuic uoluptati lzoc adz'unctumst odium
Cur i. 3. 34. If the phrase odiorum Ilias is sound here, it is
probably a literal translation of the Gk. original.

745. seruientis seruitutem: see on 95.

747. meo rem remigio gero, “ 1 take the matter into my
own hands.’' The constant recurrence of metaphors taken
from nautica] life betrays the adventitious character of Roman
Comedy. These figures, so natural to the ears of a seafaring
Athenian audience, are quite foreign to the habits of Roman
lise: cp. the constant metaphorica] usage of celocem (e. g. 986,
As. ii. 1. 10), and the elaborate nautical figures in As. iii. 1. 16,

Epid. i. 1. 47. See also below, 915—92 1.

749. quod occepi = ut occepi.

751. ueterem atque antiquam. Veterem is “hackneyed,
worn out,'’ as in uetus fabula, ueteres nummi ‚· but antiquam

is merely “old, of old standing‚'' not necessarily the worse for
the wear, and it is generally used in a good sense as artes anti-

quae Trin. i. 2. 34, antiqui mores ib. ii. 2. 18.
7 52. proletario, “ common, low, vulgar’' = plebeio, uili.

753. i: se. plebei, uz'les homines, taken out of proletario ,· so
earum refers to mulieres, implied in muliebri 187.

756. ampliter: see on 260.

758. probus, generally of moral qualities as in 735, but ap-
plied to architectus to denote technical skill in 915, and to mers
in 728, and in Poen. 2. 129 ; so affer lzuc duas clauas sedpro-
bas Rud. iii. 5. 203 nummiprobe numerati Pers. 111. 3. 33.

760. dimidiati. Cato applies this word to persons buried
in earth “up to the waist''; here it means “from the waist

,up-’5

764. atque, “in comparison with what Ι could tell,’' like
prae ut, so in 1130: cp. also 400. The Latins say “I can
tell,” where we should rather ⁵1²²,OE “ Ι could tell ”; so longum est
dicere is the Lat. for “it ‘’w'ere‘YEdious to tell.” Pl. uses in
the same way morast Capt. iv. 3. 6, inscitiast Poen. iv. 2. 99,
parumst Trin. v. 3. 10, segnities merast Trin. iii. 3. 67, nimis
longus sermost Men. v. 2. 8; non est locus Truc. iv. 4. 24.
