138 MILES GLORIOS VS.

also gives locuples as· an explanation offortis, and certainly this
meaning seems to suit Trm, v, 2. 9, and Pers. v. 2. 70.

11. tam bellatorem: cp. tam z'n amici 7413 tam pro nota
901 ; tam matula Pers. iv. 3. 64 ς parum leno Ter. Phorm. 507.
So in Cic. Epp. quis est tam Lynceus Fam. ix. 2. 2 ; sometimes,
too, without any word to qualisy‚ as in haec ego tam esse quam
audio non puto Q. Fr. i. 2. 9 ; utinam tam (sc. integra) in peri-
1 ulo suisset Att. iii. 13. 2 ; so ita (sc. uectigales) fuerunt
Q. Fr. i. 1. 33. The Latinity os Cicero in his more familiar
letters naturally finds its closest parallel in the Latinity of the
Comic stage, which reproduces the familiar conversation of every·
day life in Rome. Ι have dwelt at greater length on this point
in my edition of Cicero’s Letters (Vol. 1., Introd. p. lxxx.).

12 ad = παρά, πρός = “in comparison with'': cp. 968; ad
sapientiam lzuius ille nimius nugator fuit Capt. ii. 2. 25; ut

· emerem sibi (ancillam) ad istam factem Merc. ii. 3903 so Cic.

nihil ad Persium De Or. ii. 25 ; aequiperare is always followed

by dat. or cum with abl., so it must not be taken here closely
with ad suas.

13. Curculioniis from curculio, sometimes written gurgulio,
which means both “ a throat ’' and “ a weevil.” In Trin. iv. 3.
1 1 there is a play on currere which demands the form curculio,
while the sense demands the meaning “ throat.’' Curculioniis

is a comic coinage; the reading is very uncertain, as also in
next verse z see critical note.

14. Bumbomachides “ Bombastes Furioso.” Clut. =
κλυτομηστωριδυσαρχίδης, and is compounded of κλυτὸς μήστωρ
and δυσαρχία. This personage was not a μήστωρ φόβοιο, like the
Homeric heroes, but a μήστωρ δυσαρχίας (riot, mutiny) ς or per-
haps δυσαρχίδης is a patronym. from a coined δύσαρχος- (imperi
incapax) ; or else we should read δυσαρκτίδης = “ ungovern-
able.” In these words I have given the form nearest to the best
mss, and have not recorded the many guesses of the edd. Such
coinages are made chiefly for their sound, like Chrononhoton-
totontlzologos and Aldiborontiphoscoplzornio. The scene should
be compared with Poen. 11., where Anthemonides recounts his
exploits. Other Milites in Plautus are Therapontigonus Plata-
gidorus in the Curculio, Cleomachus in the Bacchides, Stratip-
pocles in the Epidicus, and Stratophanes in the T ruculentus.

ις. Neptuni nepos. ‘⁴ An allusion,” says Bergk, “to Anti·
gonus Gonatas, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, who called him·
