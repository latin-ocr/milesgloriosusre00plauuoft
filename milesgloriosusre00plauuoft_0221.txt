N OTES. 135

ing houses, as may be gathered from the tone of Peripleco-
menus, 156, ff. Imbrices, which are mentioned with tegulae in
504, and in Most. 1. 2. 28, were the semicylindrical tiles which
were used to cover the lines ofjunction between the rows of flat
tiles (tegulae).

11. omissam faeiat ς habere, facere, dare, reddere, cu-
rare, tradere, are often used by Plautus and Terence, with the
past participle to denote a eompleted action. The first two
only arethus used in classical Latin (Draeger, Hist. Syn. i. 295).
The ellipse of ut before faciat and before abeat in 13 is quite
Plautine: cp. datum mihi esse . . . nuntiis praesim ac lucro
Amph. Prol. 12; uide quod opust fiat Men. ii. 3. 3. This ellipse
is frequent aster uelle facere and sinere (see 50), but very common
also after optumumst, e. g. scin quid facias optumumst Men. v.
5. 44; optumumst loces Aul. iii. 6. 31 ; adeam optumumst As. ii.
4. 42; taceam optumumst Epid. i. 1. 59; capillum promittam
optumumst Rud. ii. 3. 46 ; so also after iustum in Bacch. iv. 9.
71, z‘ustumst tuos tibi seruos seruiat ,· and after decretumst in
Poen. ii. 53; we find ellipse of ut after adigere Rud. iii. 3.
19; impetrare Trin. ii. 4. 190; suadere Trin. iii. 2. 553 orare
Amph. i. 1. 1013 dicere Stich. iv. 2. 44; mandare Merc. ii. 2.
9²3 rogare Most. iii. 1. 150. We have, moreover, cedo bibam in
Most. ii. 1. 263 and date bibat in Stich. v. 5. 16.

ARGUMENT 11.

1. ingenuam. Philocomasium was not ingenua, as is plain
from all the references in the play. The writer of the Argu-
ment was misled by 490, where not Philocomasium, but the
pretended twin-sister of Philocomasium, is described as in-
genua et libera. Hence patre et matre Atticis, the reading of
Lorenz in v. 100, can by no means be accepted.

5. ut nuntiaret . . nauigat. This sequence of tenses (corn-
mon ³¹². classical prose after a Praesens historicum) is not infre-
}LlJe-liiutaitn Plautus. Conversely, we have below, 131, dedi . . . ut
