F. Ι am glad, I arn so aequit of this tinderbox; his thests are
too open; his filching is like an unskilful singem he keeps not

tune.
N. The good humour is to steal at a moment's notice.
P. Convey, the wise it caH; steal, soh! a fico sor the phrase!
F. Well, Sirs, Ι am almost out at heels.
P. Why then let kibes ensue.
F. There is no remedy ; Ι must eony-catch; Ι must shift.
P. Young ravens must have sood.
F. Which of you know Ford, of this town?
P. 1 ken the wight; he is of substance good.
F. My honest lads, I will tell you what Ι am about.
P. Two yards, and more.

F. No quips now, Pistol: indeed, Ι am in the waist two
yards about; but 1 arn now about no waste; Ι am about
thrift; briefly, 1 do mean to make love to Ford’s wife.
