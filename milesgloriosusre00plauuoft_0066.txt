THE PLAGUE OF A SERVING MAN.

A plague of my master to send me out this dreadful dark
night to bring the news ofhis victory to my lady ? and was Ι not
bewitched for going on his errand without a convoy sor the safe-
guard οἰ my person? How am I melted into sweat with sear!
Ι am diminished of my natural weight above two stone. Ι shall
not bring half mysels home again to my poor wife and family. Ι
have been in ague fit ever since shut of evem'ng‚ what with the
sright of trees by the highway, which looked maliciously like
thieves by moonshine, and with bulrushes by the river· -side that
shaked 111 e spears and lances at me. Well, the greatest plague
of a servingman is to be hired to some great lord! They care
not what dmdgery they put upon us, while they lie lolliyng at
their ease a· bed, and stretch their lazy limbs.

Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
Ham. No, you’ll reveal it.

But you'll be secret ?

But he's an arrant knave.

To tell us this.
