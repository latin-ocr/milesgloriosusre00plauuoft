acied. R, in his New Excursuses on Plautus, has advocated
the frequent introduction of a final d, not only in nouus, adjec-
tives‚ and pronouns, but also in adverbs, prepositions, and im-
peratives. Corssen distinctly rejects the final d, except on the
authority of mss„ which only give med, ted, sed (acc. and abt).
In prepositions antid and postid are defended by many 3 and we
have sed, red, and prod in compounds. For adverbs we have no
authority but sacilumed in the Sctum de Bacanalz'bus. It is
perhaps safe with Biicheler (Lat. Decl.) to recognise d in med,
ted, sed, and all ablatives, but not elsewhere. Koch would here
read fostz‘bus sor hostibus, and farz'olus for hariolus 692. This
is rather a strong measure, though Festus tells us “ foedum
antiqui dicebant pro lzaed0‚folus pro holere, fostem pro hoste,
fostz'am pro hostia ’'‚· and Varro says that lzz‘rcus was fircus in
Sabine, and fedus was a provincial pronunciation of edus
(haedus). Quintilian speaks of fordeum as a form of hordeum.
