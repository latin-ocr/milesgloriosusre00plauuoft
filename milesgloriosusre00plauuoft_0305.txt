N OTES . 203

882. ultro, “unaslred.⁷'

883. morium, “a particle.’' Morz'um is the Latinized form
of μόριον, a particle. Pl. very osten gives a Greek word a Latin
ixlflexion-—as in dulice, euscheme, comoedia-e, compsz‘ssume-in
this play; and prothymz'am Stich. ii. 2. 11 ; eccheumatis
Poen. iii. 3. 88. We also find musice, basilice, more (μωρῶς),
prothyme, pancrattcc, athletice. Ritschl's lorcam, which has
been generally accepted, is not at all like moram ofthe mss,
and such an expression is utterly unsuited to Acr. : “the small
thin wine of your discourse ” is much too high-flown for Aer„
and is not in any way borne out by her other words. Adbz'bere
auribus is such a very common figure that it does not in any
way justisy the introduction of lorcam. In fact, adbibere auri-
bus can hardly be called a figurative expression at all. The use
of Gk. words with Lat. inflexions is quite a characteristic ofOld
Lat„ e. g. schemam (σχῆμα) Amph. prol. 1173 glaucumam
(γλαύκωμα) Mil. 148; and Priscian quotes syrmam from Vale-
rius ; dz'ademam from Pomponius; dogmam from Laberius;
so lampadis (abl.) should probably be read in Men. v. 2. 28;
aud lampadam Cas. iv. 4. 16: cp. also architectus in 901,
though we find arclzitectones 919, architectonem Most. iii. 2. 73.
So also Tranz'zcs for T rania, Alcmeus for Ἀλκμέων, Electrus for
Ἠλεκτρύων.

884. petisset :potesset :posset; so potz‘ssz't= possit, potz'sse =
posse.

deasciari. This word means “to hue or cut with an axe,’'
and is usually applied to the removing of rough excrescences;
hence = “to smooth or polish ’'; so dermzcz'nare, 1142, means
“to plane off.'¹ These words may both be translated by our
slang phrase, “to polish off’'; the phrases mean “to cheat,
cajole‚” the victim of the imposture being compared to the
wood which thejoiner fashions as he pleases‚just as the cunning
slave makes the Miles believe what he pleases. The idea
uuderlying the phrase succedit sub manus negotium (“accom·
modates itself to my manipulation '') is somewhat similar.

886. regionem: see on 233.

888. meminisse = ὥστε μεμνῆσθαι.· cp. celerem sequi Hor.
Carm. i. 15. 183 catus iaculari, celer excipere Ib. iii. 12.

891. ergo . . . utrumque, “that is why Ι am afraid of this
very thing (viz. forgetfulness), because in this case what we
have to do partakes of both qualities” (good and bad).
