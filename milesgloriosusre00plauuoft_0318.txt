1279. illi = illic.

sies in expectatione, “ See that you don't keep us wait-
ing '’ : cp. esse in quaestione alicui, ‘⁴ to keep people looking for
one’' capt. ii. 2. 33 z’n mora esse alicui Trin. ii. 2. 3.

ACT IV.—ScENE VI.

1287. admisse = admisisse.

1289. Achiles. In the mss the verse runs-
Mitto iam ut occidi Achilles ciuis passus est,

and the usual expedient has been to read enim for iam, so as to
preserve the metre. I have adopted the far simpler correction
of striking out one l in Achilles (see on 1054). The reading
enim is not only unlikely as a conjecture (for why would enim
have been corrupted into iam os the mss Ρ), but it is absolutely
inadmissible. Langen (Bez'trcige, pp. 261-271) shows that enim
in Plautus is never causal (never = nam), but always corrobora-
tive; though in Terence it is used in the same sense as nam
(e. g. Hec. 8335 Ad. 647). Hence Langen rejects Geppert’s
nanctum enim for namque enim of the mss in Trin. i. 2. 23;
and rightly explains enim as corroborative in some passages
where it might seem to be causal. I find he suggests the same
correction as had occurred to me in this passage. The correc-
tion had been made in my critical notes before his Bez'trcige had
appeared.

1293. nam, “ sor instance.’' Nam often introduces a case in
point after the statement of a general maxim.

129 5. hoe . . . consuetudine, “ so completely is dilatoriness
their habit ”t cp. id nzmcfacz's hau consuetudine Trin. ii. 2. 83.
But that verse is very probably an interpolation.

1309. abstinuissem. For the construction see n. on 187.
The old edd. (whom even Lorenz follows) read thus :-

Marz's causa hercle istoc ego oculo utor minus
Nam si abstinuissem a mare, eo tamquam hoc uterer-3

they suppose there is a play on amare “ to have a love affair‚”
and a mare ‘⁴ from the sea.’' Pleusicles is made to say, “ It is
the sea which has injured my eye; if I had kept away from tlte
sea (if I had kept out of love being his real meaning), it would
