PREFACE.

THIS Edition aims at two ends. Firstâ€š it seeks to
supply an adequate apparatus criticus, in so far as
this is compatible with the design of the series in
wsieh it appears. Such an apparatus can be had
only in Ritschl's ed. of the Miles, which is long
since out of print. The present edition gives the
readings of BCD (not, however, going into detail,
except in special cases), and those ofA whenever they
are recorded by RitschL Geppert, or Studemund.
Moreover, it aims at embodying the results of
the most important critical labours on the Miles
{rom the time of Ritschl's ed. to the present
year. For this purpose I have carefully studied
[he German periodicals which have appeared since
the ed. of Dr. Brix, 1875. Dr. Brix remarks how
rich in Plautine criticism was the quarter of a
century which intervened between Ritschl's ed.
an his own. Even since Brix much has been
done: indeed so great is the energy with which
Plautine studies are being prosecuted in Germany,
that no edition can claim to represent the best text
of a play of Plautus for more than a few years
