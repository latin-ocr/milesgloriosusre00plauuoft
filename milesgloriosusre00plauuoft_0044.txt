The scene is Ephesus, the street in front of the

houses of Periplecomenus and the MzJes, which latter
was to the right of the spectator, as may be inferred
from verses 361, 1216. Before the house of Periple-
comenus was the altar which usually stood on the
Greek stage3 it was in strictness sacred to Apollo,
but could be used for sacrifices to other deities; aS,

THAT the prosody of Plautus differs widely from the

· prosody of the Augustan poets is universally ac-

knowledged. Many attempts have been made to miti-
gate this difference‚ or at least to bring the various
discrepancies under a few rules. In carrying out
such attempts editors have sometimes resorted to
conjecture in the most unsparing fashion, and in
many cases have finally been forced to give up some
of their rules, to introduce others, and indeed not
so much to modify their former views as to propound
altogether new ones. This will appear clearly from
a comparison of Ritschl's Preface to the Trinummus
(prefixed to his ed. of 1848) with his Neue Plauti—
nz‘sclze Excume, 1869.

The broad discrepancies between Plautine and
Augustan prosody may be classified under four
heads:—

(A) Long vowels found short in Plautus.
(B) Short vowels found long in Plautus.
(C) Large tolerance of hiatus in Plautus.
(D) Large tolerance of synizesis in Plautus.
