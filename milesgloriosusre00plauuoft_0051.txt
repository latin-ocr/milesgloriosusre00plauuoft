IN TE OD U ΟΤΙ ON. xxvii

(6). Hiatus in the thesis ofthe fifth foot in senarii,
as

utinam fortuna nunc anatina ΙΙ uterer.·—-Rud. ii. 6. 49.
narn fulguritae sunt alternae ΙΙ arbores—Tria ii. 4. 138.

Ritschl utterly rejects this hiatus. In the first
verse quoted he would read analz'nad; in the second
he introduces alternas as a nom. plur. of rst decl.

(7). Hiatus in the interests of the sense3 when
there is a full stop, and a new clause begins, as

Sed iixorern ante aedis eccam. Ei misero mihi; ⁴⁶

or when the actor is intended to pause, as

nunc edepol demum in memoriam regredior quom cogito
quasi per nebulam Η Hegionem patrem meum uocarier.

In this case editors usually read nebulas ‚· Weise
actually supposes the first syll. of nebulam to be
lengthened. But it may well be supposed that the
actor was intended to pause after nebulam in his
dreamy retrospect of childhood‚ just as Hamlet
sa s:

y Must give us pause. There's the respect,

where a whole foot is left out to bring into promi-
nence the fact that after the wordpause the sense re-
quires a lengthened stop. For the same reason, that
the structure of the verse may, by a moliminous
movement, refiect the thought, Euripides writes:

Ἀτλας ὁ χαλκέοισι νώτοις οὐρανόν,

where he might, of course, have easily written
instead:
Ἀτλας ὁ νώτοις χαλκέοισιν οὐρανόν.

³ Is we scanned zixorem, and made no hiatus, the accen!
would be violated throughout.
