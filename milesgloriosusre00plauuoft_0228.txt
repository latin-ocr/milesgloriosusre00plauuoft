142 MILES GL ΟΕ] OS Vs.

33-36. aside.

34. peraurienda. This word and dentiant are comic coin-
ages to suit auribus and dentibus like ruri rurant Capt. i. 1. 16;
domi domitus Men. i. Ι. 29 ; exauspicaui . . . redauspican-
dum Capt. iii. 5. 109.

35. mentibitur: cp. scibit 860 Capt. iii. 86; audibis
Capt. iii. 4. 86; in Pers. i. 1. 15, we have congrediar and adgre-
dzbor 1n same verse.

39. Scytholatronia, from Scythes and latrones = ‘⁴ mercena-
ries.'’ R reads Cryplzz'olatlzronia (κρύφιος λάθρα), which would
mean the land that is hidden from men‘s eyes, “Kennaqu-
hair‚'’ “ Weissnichtwo '’; cp. Cur. iii. 74—76, where Perediam
et Perbibesiam may be rendered “Eatanswill‚” and where Con-
tenebrom'am supplies perhaps a reason for reading erplziola-
thr-onia here.

40. Sardeis. This is an archaic form os nom. plur. znd decl.
= Sardi, which Plautus uses (instead of Sardianz) to mean “the
natives of Sardes.’' Sardi in later Latin means “ Sardinians.'’
This archaic form of nom. plur. occurs again in 374 hisce oculis,
in Men. ii. 2. 17 sacres sinceri, and v. 9. 96, where fundis =
fundi should be read; it is the invariable form in hisce illisce.
We find ln Inscriptions Minuceis magzlrtreis, publicez's, conscrip-
teis, gnateis, sacteis= Minucii &a Even in the A decl. R
and, ΒΧ would introduce a similar form in alternas arbores sor
alternae Trin. ii. 4. 138.

41. una uno die. The adverb una always refers in
Plautus to an action taking place at one time and in one'
place, as has been thoroughly shown by P. Langen, Beitrdge
zur Krztz'k und Erkliirung des Plautus (Leipzig, 1880),
p. 243. Hence Langen here accepts the unscientific and
obvious expedient of Pylades, the transposition of tu and
quos, because, as he thinks, the succeeding words uno die
are inconsistent with this view of the Plautine usage of una.
But they are not inconsistent with it. They serve to heighten
the comic hyperbole of the passage. The stroke that slew all
these rnen was but one stroke, delivered in one place and at one
time, but the time necessary sor the delivery of this portentous
passado was one whole day.

43. tantum. The neuter is common in Plautus, especially
after sums of money: cp. minas quadraginta . . . eo Trin. ii.
