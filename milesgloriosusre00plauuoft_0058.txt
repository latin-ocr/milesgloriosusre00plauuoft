(b). 884. For deasciari CD give deascdarz', by a mis-
take of one letter, d for τ’. F gives deas dm,- Z
oleas dare.

(c). 991. M gives rightly hasce ante aedis circust,·
F (followed by Z) misunderstands the metaphorical
use of circus, though it is explained by the rest ofthe
verse, and reads, by an absurd conjecture, hircus, by
which word the Milts is supposed to be designated.

(d). 1255. Scio edepol sacile; CD present facio for
facila· F, by a wretched conjecture, reads olfacio,

have taken a different course from other edd. in the
recension of the text :———

100. For matre I read acre.

231. Ι restore ad me of the mss, striking out te,
usually inserted without ms authority.

236. Ι read with the mss ego mi z‘sluc scio.

311 . I read mussabo for mussitabo.

587. A verse is suggested to fill up the lacuna.

604. After quippe Ι supply qui, not sior enim.

606. Afterfacere I supply re, not lum or z'llz'.

693. I defend quae of M, A, and Festus, against quo
of FZ.

779. 1 defend non of all the mss against nunc, the
