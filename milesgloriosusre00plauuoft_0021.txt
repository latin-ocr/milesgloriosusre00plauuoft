ΤΟ THE SEOOND EDITION.

such as examussim, inter sacrum et saxum, enim as
first word, Athenae Atticae—the latter phrase proba-
bly borrowed from this very verse. To the examples
of acre for acriter which I have given, Ussing adds

acre aeger, Varro ap. Non. 5133 and, as parallel,
he quotes memore, dapsile, from Pomponius, and per-

spz'cace from Afranius.

Professor Ussing, I arn gratified to find, accepts
my conjecture and reads acre in his text. He has
also accepted my restoration of ad me in 231, my
quszpe qui in 604, as well as my views about the text
in 1054 and 1289, where, however, he prints Achilles
in both places, though he regards the penult as
short. Perhaps rightly. O. Ribbeck reads Achiles
in both places.

It has been suggested to me by Mr. Bury that dixi
ego istuc might mean, “the order is (as good as)
given.’' Per. could not have actually given the
order, as he had not left the stage; hence nuntiabo
in 196. The same most promising young scholar
suggests that in 743—

Verum ubi dies decem continuos sit, east odiorum Ilias—
in the word decem there is an allusion to the ten

years’ siege of Troy: this would be an additional
argument for the soundness of odiorum Ilias.
